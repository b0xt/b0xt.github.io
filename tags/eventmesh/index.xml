      <description>Today we share Apache EventMesh event-driven distributed application runtime, which is a relatively new concept, and we hope we can bring some inspiration to you through this sharing.
We all understand two concepts - message and event. Message refers to the update of a specific event, and this update is sent from one point to another after the message is deleted, and the message is a temporary state of existence; while event refers to what happens at a specific time, it is not bound to a specific recipient or client, and it is often can be replayed, backtracked and reworked.</description>
