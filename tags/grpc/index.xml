      <description>Apache Dubbo has the injvm method of communication, which can avoid the latency caused by the network, and also does not occupy the local port, which is a more convenient way of RPC communication for testing and local verification. I recently saw containerd&amp;rsquo;s code and found that it has similar requirements. But using ip port communication, there may be port conflict; using unix socket, there may be path conflict.

      <description>My blog server has two ports open, one for serving HTTP requests and one for serving gRPC requests from clients. Later, after learning more about gRPC, I found out that the underlying transport layer protocol is actually based on HTTP/2. At the same time, I saw the official NGINX gRPC support. So I wanted to use NGINX to proxy gRPC requests so that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to think about the</description>

      <description>I. WebSocket WebSocket is a two-way communication protocol that uses the HTTP/1.1 protocol in the handshake phase (HTTP/2 is not supported at this time). The handshake process is as follows. First the client initiates a special HTTP request to the server with the following message header. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 GET /chat HTTP/1.1 // 请求行 Host: server.example.com Upgrade: websocket // required Connection: Upgrade //</description>
