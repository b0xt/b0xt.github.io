      <title>VXLAN Protocol for Cloud-Native Virtual Networks</title>

      <description>The first time I got to know VXLAN was when I looked at a network plugin called flannel used in k8s that has a VXLAN mode, which implements an Overlay Network that connects all containers together. So in this article, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at how VXLAN connects the networks between different containers.
Overview Before we look at VXLAN, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at its predecessor, VLAN, whose full name is Virtual Local Area Network, a layer 2 (data link layer) network used to partition broadcast domains.</description>

      <description>Overview The mainstream virtual NIC solutions are tun/tap and veth, with tun/tap appearing much earlier in time. The kernel released after Linux Kernel version 2.4 compiles tun/tap driver by default, and tun/tap is widely used. In the cloud-native virtual network, flannel0 in the UDP mode of flannel is a tun device, and OpenVPN also uses tun/tap for data forwarding.
veth is another mainstream virtual NIC solution. In Linux Kernel version 2.</description>

      <description>Exploration of the definition of cloud-native The concept of &amp;ldquo;cloud native&amp;rdquo; is mentioned, but how many people really understand this concept? Whenever I browse some communities (not least some professional technical communities) and see some friends discussing cloud-native related topics, I sometimes feel that there is still a little bit of a problem with their understanding of cloud-native.
Many people directly think that applications deployed in the cloud are called cloud-native applications.</description>

      <description>ClickHouse is a column-oriented database management system (DBMS) for online analytical processing (OLAP) of queries. Clickhouse Features A true column-oriented DBMS In a true column-oriented DBMS, no additional data is stored along with the values. Beyond that, this means that constant length values must be supported to avoid storing their length &amp;ldquo;numbers&amp;rdquo; next to the values. For example, a billion UInt8 type values should consume about 1 GB uncompressed, otherwise</description>

      <title>How cloud native is putting us out of work</title>

      <description>I am temporarily unemployed, so this article does not represent the views of any employer.
By 2021, most companies have decided to embrace cloud-native, but many programmers&amp;rsquo; understanding of cloud-native is limited to &amp;ldquo;native k8s-based applications&amp;rdquo;. If a company goes to the cloud (k8s), it&amp;rsquo;s embracing cloud-native. Those with a little more understanding think that if we go to service mesh in addition to k8s, we are embracing cloud-native.
The cncf&amp;rsquo;s definition of cloud-native is in fact very complex.</description>
