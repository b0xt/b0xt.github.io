      <title>Talking about synchronization in concurrent programming</title>

      <description>Interaction inside concurrent programs Why should we consider the problem of synchronization? In many cases, we need multiple processes or threads to cooperate with each other to complete a task, and multiple serial programs may all have to access a shared resource, or pass some data to each other. In this case, we need to coordinate the execution of the programs. The role of synchronization is to avoid possible conflicts during concurrent access to shared resources, as well as to ensure the orderly passing of information.</description>

      <description>This article describes how to create a virtual bridge in centos8 using the nmcli tool and add a physical NIC to the virtual bridge to make it a Layer 2 switch.
This operation is not only applicable to physical NIC devices, but also to virtual NIC devices of various virtual machines.
The goal is to combine all three NICs in the red box into a Layer 2 switch. First we need to create a bridge device, which is the functional equivalent of the switch we normally use.</description>

      <title>CentOS execution of grub2-mkconfig causes disk to be read-only</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-01/centos-grub2-mkconfig/</link>

      <description>I recently encountered a failure where a disk partition was found to become read-only during a cluster software upgrade, causing the storage application to recognize the disk as unavailable. Investigation revealed that the cluster upgrade process regenerates the GRUB configuration file for each node, which causes the disk partition to become read-only during the execution of grub2-mkconfig. Document the flow of the grub2-mkconfig command execution until the real disk read-only command is issued.</description>
