      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s technological age, we have witnessed a huge leap in the use of Internet and networked devices. Every home has a laptop, smartphone, digital watch, IoT devices, home automation components and other devices connected to the home network or the Internet. Devices communicate with each other over a variety of network protocols, of which TCP and IP are the most commonly used. Each device connected to the network must have an IP address that identifies the device on the network.</description>

      <description>Bypass routing is a homelab common requirement, the main route with hard routing to ensure stability, such as using Mikrotik&amp;rsquo;s RouterOS router as the main route, bypass routing using OpenWrt as a soft route to achieve advanced features such as ad filtering and tunneling, these functions are often not hardware accelerated and need to consume a lot of CPU to complete, x86 high performance soft routing is a very suitable choice.</description>

      <description>The network layer protocol assumes the two major functions of packet forwarding and routing, and it can provide the upper layer with the responsibility of transporting packets between different hosts. IP protocol, as a network layer protocol, plays an extremely critical role in today&amp;rsquo;s Internet, although it can only provide connectionless and unreliable services.
In general, when we want to access services provided by other hosts, we need to access the target host through an IP address, which is the only way to be accessed by other hosts on the Internet.</description>
