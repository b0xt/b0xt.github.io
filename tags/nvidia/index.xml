      <description>On May 11, NVIDIA announced in a blog post that it has officially open sourced its Linux GPU kernel module under a dual GPL/MIT license.
It is well known that NVIDIA has been very resistant to embracing open source, unlike its old rival AMD, which is very enthusiastic about open source. Although they provide excellent Linux driver support, their private, closed-source drivers have been criticized by the Linux community. For example, the famous Linus + middle finger + &amp;ldquo;So, fxxk you NVIDIA&amp;rdquo;, and the Fedora project lead has posted bashing NVIDIA for its proprietary driver software stack.</description>
