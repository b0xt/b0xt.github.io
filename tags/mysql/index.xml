      <description>Definition of Containers: Containers are designed to solve the problem of &amp;ldquo;how to ensure that the software can run properly when switching runtime environments&amp;rdquo;.
Currently, containers and Docker are still the hottest words in the technology field, stateless services containerization has been the trend, but also brings a hot issue is debated by everyone: database MySQL need to be containerized?
We carefully analyze the various views of everyone, and find that those who agree are only elaborating MySQL needs containerization from the perspective of container advantages, with little business scenarios to verify their views; on the other hand, if we look at the opponents, they elaborate MySQL does not need containerization from multiple factors such as performance and data security, and also cite some unsuitable business scenarios.</description>

      <description>When I was developing my own project, I needed to use MySQL for unit testing, so I started a MySQL container locally using docker, imitating the way of go-txdb. When I executed the test, the following error occurred.
1 2 mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure. ERROR 2059 (HY000): Authentication plugin &amp;#39;caching_sha2_password&amp;#39; cannot be loaded: dlopen(/usr/local/mysql/lib/plugin/caching_sha2_password.so, 2): image not found Cause Analysis Conclusion: The local client version is too low and does not support the server-side version of the authentication method.</description>

      <description>binlog is a binary file saved by mysql, which can be used to recover data, synchronize data, etc.
If you want Mysql to generate binlog automatically, you need to turn it on in the configuration file.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know where your mysql default configuration file is? You can find it with the following command.
1 2 3 mysql --help | grep &amp;#39;Default options&amp;#39; -A 1 /etc/my.cnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf ~/.my.cnf vim /etc/my.</description>

      <description>What exactly is MVCC? Definition: Multi-Version Concurrency Control , literally, the use of multiple versions for reasonable control during concurrency (that&amp;rsquo;s how I took it literally anyway), obviously this thing is an abstract concept, and it is. It is mainly found in some data management software. Maintaining multiple versions of a data makes the read and write operations conflict-free. Why is this thing there?

      <description>Today, a colleague found a bug in MySQL regarding fuzzy lookups, which is quite embarrassing to say the least. When I saw the problem, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what I had written wrong.
The problem was that I meant to find rows in the database starting with abc_, but I ended up with a statement that looked like the following
1 SELECT * FROM users_tab WHERE name LIKE &amp;#39;abc_%&amp;#39;; Can you find the desired results this way?</description>

      <description>MySQL INSERT INTO Statement The CREATE TABLE statement enables you to create columns, while the INSERT statement enables you to insert rows or records into a table.The INSERT statement is an example of the Data Manipulation Language (DML).

      <description>Why MySQL uses B+ trees is a question that often comes up in interviews. Many people may have some understanding of this question, but most answers are incomplete and inaccurate, and most people simply talk about the difference between B+ and B trees. But none of them really answer the question of why MySQL chooses to use B+ trees. In this article, we will analyze in depth some of the reasons behind MySQL&amp;rsquo;s choice of B+ trees.</description>

      <title>Why does the database lose data</title>

      <description>Database management systems are an important part of software today. Open source databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and commercial Oracle are everywhere, and almost all services rely on database management systems to store data.
It sounds like a matter of course that a database will not lose data, and persistence capability should be the most basic guarantee of a database, but in this complex world it is very difficult to guarantee that data will not be lost.</description>

      <title>Why MySQL&#39;s self-incrementing primary keys are not monotonic or continuous</title>

      <description>When we work with relational databases, the primary key is a concept that cannot be avoided. The primary key acts as an identifier for a record, and we can locate a unique record in a table by its identifier.
In a relational database, we choose the smallest subset of multiple fields in a record as the unique identifier for that record in the table. Depending on the definition of a primary key in a relational database, we can choose either a single column as the primary key or multiple columns as the primary key, but the primary key must exist and be unique throughout the record.</description>

      <description>In the process of using MySQL, I have some questions about the concepts of MyISAM and InnoDB, and what is the difference between the two engines has always been a question in my mind. In order to solve this puzzle, I searched the web and found the following information.
MyISAM is the default database engine of MySQL (before version 5.5), improved by the earlier ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method). Although the performance is excellent, it has one drawback: it does not support transaction.</description>

      <title>MySQL High Performance Storage Engine TokuDB</title>

      <description>When installing MariaDB, I learned about TokuDB, which replaces InnoDB, and it&amp;rsquo;s great to see the introduction.
What is TokuDB? The most popular MySQL engine that supports full transactions is INNODB, which is characterized by the fact that the data itself is organized by B-TREE, which is a huge B-TREE index clustered by primary key. So at this point, the write speed will be somewhat reduced, because to write each time to use an IO to do the index tree rearrangement.</description>

      <description>The MySQL master-slave architecture has been widely used, and the stability of the master-slave replication relationship is a constant concern.
MySQL 5.6 provides a new feature for master-slave replication stability: slave support crash-safe. This feature can solve the problem of relay_log.info bit inaccuracy caused by abnormal power failure in previous versions.
In this article, we will introduce this feature in terms of principle, parameters, and new issues.
