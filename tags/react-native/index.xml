      <description>Colleague&amp;rsquo;s feedback React Native project startup reported an error indicating version mismatch, the error screenshot is as follows.

We can find out that RN has a version check at startup through this error, how is the specific mechanism, let&amp;rsquo;s follow the source code together.</description>
