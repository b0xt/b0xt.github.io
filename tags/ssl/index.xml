      <description>Introduction to SSL/TLS When we use the HTTP protocol, the data transmitted is insecure, because all data going to and from the client and the server is in plaintext:.
 Third parties can get access to the real data Third parties can tamper with the data Third parties can impersonate the server or client  The full name of HTTPS is Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, which is used to exchange information securely (secure communication) between two end systems on a computer network, which is equivalent to adding a Secure secure word eye to HTTP, then we can give a HTTPS definition: HTTPS is a protocol and specification for secure transmission of text, images, audio, video and other hypertext data between two points in the computer world.</description>
