      <description>On Tuesday, researchers discovered a new vulnerability in microprocessors from Intel, AMD and other companies that targets the power-conservation mode on nearly all modern CPUs and can be exploited by remote attackers to steal cryptographic keys through a power-side channel attack.
A group of researchers from the University of Texas, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Washington named this attack Hertzbleed, which centers on dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), the power and thermal management function used to conserve energy and reduce heat generated by the chip.</description>

      <description>AMD open source engineers have come up with a new kernel feature called &amp;ldquo;PAN&amp;rdquo; (Process Adaptive autoNUMA), and early data shown by AMD suggests that PAN can help improve the performance of certain workloads on its latest server hardware to some extent.
PAN is an adaptive algorithm for calculating AutoNUMA scan periods, as further explained by Bharata B Rao of AMD in the Request for Comments (RFC) Linux Kernel Patch Series:</description>
