      <description>ebpf is an innovative and revolutionary technology that enables sandboxed programs to be run in the kernel without modifying the kernel source code or loading kernel modules. By making the Linux kernel programmable, it is possible to build smarter, more feature-rich infrastructure software based on existing (rather than adding new) abstraction layers, without increasing system complexity or sacrificing execution efficiency or security.

      <description>On August 12, 2021 EST, Google, Microsoft, Isovalent, Facebook, and Netflix jointly announced the formation of a new non-profit organization, the eBPF Foundation, under the auspices of the Linux Foundation. The Foundation is dedicated to better promoting the open source project eBPF and supporting the commercial growth of Linux and other open source technologies.
In recent years, the number of eBPF projects has exploded and more and more projects are interested in using eBPF, so it is increasingly important to optimize collaboration between projects, ensure that the core of eBPF is well maintained and configure a clear roadmap for the future of eBPF.</description>
