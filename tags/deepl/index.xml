      <description>This blog post should have been published last year when I finished reversing the DeepL client, but I delayed starting it because I was afraid that once the relevant details were made public, they would be widely adopted by others and blocked by the DeepL official. Some time ago I released DeepL Docker image of Free Api, and also made the binary public on GitHub. I believe DeepL will be in action soon, so I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to make the details public.</description>
