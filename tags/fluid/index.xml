      <description>Fluid is a cloud-native distributed data set orchestration and acceleration engine, mainly serving data-intensive applications in cloud-native scenarios, such as big data applications, AI applications, and so on. In this paper, we will introduce the main working principle of Fluid from two aspects: data orchestration and data acceleration.
Architecture The whole architecture of Fluid is divided into two main parts.
One is the Controller, including RuntimeController and DatasetController, which manage the lifecycle of Runtime and Dataset respectively, and both of them work together to build a complete distributed caching system based on helm chart, usually in the form of master + worker + fuse to provide services upwards.</description>
