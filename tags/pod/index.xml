      <description>Pods is now the minimum deployment unit for containers in Kubernetes. Similar support is provided by Podman. Although podman-compose works almost identically. But this is a good concept in terms of convenience, security and later migration to k8s.
The specific architecture is as follows.
To use the pod function of podman, make sure that catatonit is installed in advance.
Common commands Create a pod 1 2 sudo podman pod create -n test-pod 850580d6a80befc5efd015213f5887c750577988bbd4bb753e0a5f4a1037e1f7 List all pods 1 2 3 âˆ´ sudo podman pod list POD ID NAME STATUS CREATED INFRA ID # OF CONTAINERS 850580d6a80b test-pod Created About a minute ago 5b40275320b0 1 Add a container to a pod Adds a container of top to the pod named test-pod created earlier.</description>

      <title>Adding DNS records to Pods</title>

      <description>We all know that Pods in a StatefulSet have separate DNS records. For example, if a StatefulSet is named etcd and its associated Headless SVC is named etcd-headless, CoreDNS will resolve an A record for each of its Pods as follows.
etcd-0.etcd-headless.default.svc.cluster.local etcd-1.etcd-headless.default.svc.cluster.local &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; So can other Pods besides the one managed by StatefulSet also generate DNS records?
As shown below, we only have a Headless SVC here, not a Pod managed by StatefulSet, but a Pod managed by ReplicaSet, and we can see that it seems to generate resolution records similar to those in StatefulSet.</description>
