      <description>Recently, the most popular open source lightweight Java framework Spring was exposed to a high-risk RCE (Remote Control Equipment) zero-day vulnerability , Peking University Computing Center, praetorian, bleepingcomputer and other sites have reported on the vulnerability.
According to a wildly popular online introduction, the RCE vulnerability stems from the SerializationUtils#dserialize method at the core of the Spring framework, which is based on Java&amp;rsquo;s serialization and deserialization mechanism and can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), which can potentially affect anyone using JDK9 and above.</description>
