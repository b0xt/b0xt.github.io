      <description>I recently bought a new laptop, and the first thing I had to do after getting the computer was to configure the machine learning environment. Some mistakes were made in the middle, so they were sorted out for those who might need them. Installing Windows Subsystem WLS2 The main reasons for updating from WSL 1 to WSL 2 include improved file system performance. Support for full system call compatibility. WSL</description>

      <title>TensorFlow to depart from YAML due to code execution vulnerability, recommends developers switch to JSON</title>

      <description>Tensorflow is a Python based machine learning and artificial intelligence project developed by Google. Recently TensorFlow has dropped support for YAML in order to fix a critical code execution vulnerability.
AML or YAML Ain&amp;rsquo;t Markup Language is a human-readable data serialization language used to pass objects and store data between processes and applications, and many Python applications use YAML to serialize and deserialize objects.
The CVE ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2021-37678, and the maintainers of TensorFlow and Keras, a wrapper project for TensorFlow, say that the vulnerability stems from an insecure parsing of YAML, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code when an application deserializes a Keras model served in YAML format.</description>
