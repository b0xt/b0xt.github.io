      <title>PostgreSQL14&#39;s Continuous Archive Backup Feature</title>

      <description>Continuous Archival Backups pg has three basic backup methods.
 sql dump using pg_dump, which is a logical backup that cannot be restored to a specified state. File system based backup, requires file system to provide snapshot function to ensure consistency, otherwise must be shut down first and then backed up. Continuous archiving, the preferred high-reliability backup technology.  Continuous archiving of WAL logs is the key to implementing archived backups, combining a file system level backup with an archived WAL file, so that when recovery is required, the file system backup is restored first, and then the archived WAL file is replayed to restore the system to its current (or specified point in time) state.</description>

      <description>The Postgres conversion function is often used to instantly help PMs understand the actual status of current users and to record common commands underneath. First install the Postgres environment, this side is actually the way to use Docker to start a new Postgres DB.

      <description>Recently, I am studying PostgreSQL to do search engine, in short, the main use of the search engine is the inverted index, that is, an article or statement, the first word, the article into N words, each word has a certain weight, there are many places in this step can be optimized, the article will be cut into the exact meaning of the word, the impact on the subsequent search</description>

      <description>PostgreSQL is an open source Object-Relational Database Management System (ORDBMS), based on the original POSTGRE source code from the University of California, Berkeley, which supports most SQL standards and offers many modern features. PostgreSQL uses a C/S architecture. The server-side process (called postgres) manages the database files, receives connections from the client, and performs database operations on behalf of the client; the client-side process initiates connections to the server and</description>

      <title>PostgreSQL Foreign Data Wrappers Usage Explained</title>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/postgresql-foreign-data-wrappers/</guid>
      <description>PostgreSQL Foreign Data Wrappers (hereinafter referred to as FDW) is a very useful feature in real database usage scenarios. PostgreSQL&amp;rsquo;s FDW is similar to Oracle&amp;rsquo;s dblink and DB2&amp;rsquo;s Federation, which allows you to establish connections between local and external databases so that you can manipulate external data as if it were local data. FDW What&amp;rsquo;s the point Data sharding uses FDW to distribute data across multiple databases to achieve data</description>

      <title>PostgreSQL Tablespace Usage Explained</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/postgres-tablespaces/</link>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/postgres-tablespaces/</guid>
      <description>PostgreSQL&amp;rsquo;s tablespaces allow defining where database objects are stored in the file system. In effect, a directory is specified for the storage of data files for database objects such as tables, sequences and indexes.
PostgreSQL uses the operating system&amp;rsquo;s filesystem for storage. This is a bit different from Oracle, which implements its own &amp;ldquo;file system&amp;rdquo;.
In PostgreSQL, one tablespace can be used by multiple databases; and one database can use multiple tablespaces, in a &amp;ldquo;many-to-many&amp;rdquo; relationship.</description>

      <title>Why does the database lose data</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-12/whys-the-design-database-data-loss/</link>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-12/whys-the-design-database-data-loss/</guid>
      <description>Database management systems are an important part of software today. Open source databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and commercial Oracle are everywhere, and almost all services rely on database management systems to store data.
It sounds like a matter of course that a database will not lose data, and persistence capability should be the most basic guarantee of a database, but in this complex world it is very difficult to guarantee that data will not be lost.</description>

      <title>PostgreSQL Jsonpath Usage in Practice</title>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-06/postgresql-jsonpath-usage-in-practice/</guid>
      <description>jsonpath is a tool used to parse json data, similar to xpath, jsonpath can parse very complex json data.
PostgreSQL json development history. postgreSQL has supported json data type since 9.2, but due to the poor performance of parsing json data, it is not favored by everyone, but choose to use nosql database instead. So from pg9.4 onwards, the jsonb data type was supported. Compared to the json type, jsonb does not need to be parsed every time it is used, so the performance is much improved, and it also supports index queries and so on.</description>

      <description>When inserting a lot of data at once, using bulk inserts can significantly improve performance.
JDBC batch execute When using JDBC, you can use Statement#addBatch(String sql) or PreparedStatement#addBatch method to add SQL statements to the batch list, and then execute them in batch with the executeBatch method. When inserting a lot of data at once, using bulk inserts can significantly improve performance.
reWriteBatchedInserts=true The PostgreSQL JDBC driver supports the reWriteBatchedInserts=true join parameter to modify multiple insert/update statements into a single statement, for example: insert into test(name) values (&#39;n&#39;); insert into test(name) values (&#39;m&#39;); is modified to insert into test(name) values (&#39;n&#39;), (&#39;m&#39;); .</description>
